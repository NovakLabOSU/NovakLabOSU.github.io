      <p>Efforts to characterize and estimate the functional forms and strengths of species interactions in species-rich communities are hampered by the multitude of direct and indirect interactions such systems exhibit.
Empirical insights have also been constrained by an assumption that the feeding behaviors of specialist predators are representative of the behaviors exhibited by generalist predators, which are far more common in nature.
This is largely because logistical and statistical constraints have limited almost all studies to species-poor systems of single predator species interacting with only one primary prey species.
Even inherently generalist predators have thereby been reduced to effective specialists, whether in manipulative experiments or in time-series analyses.
New ways to quantify species interaction strengths are needed to identify keystone species,
inform the development of mathematical models,
and further our understanding of the processes that regulate community structure and dynamics.</p>
<p>Much of our work to date has sought to develop an
<a href="/tag/observational-approach">observational approach</a>
with which to overcome many of the aforementioned limitations.
The approach relies on
(1) <em>predator feeding surveys</em> for estimating the proportions of predator indivdiuals who are caught in the act of feeding on different prey categories (i.e. species), and
(2) estimates of <em>prey detection times</em>, typically derived from laboratory experiments,
that determine the probability of observing a feeding event when conducting a feeding survey.
These data allow us to estimate a predator population&rsquo;s (or predator indivdiual&rsquo;s) prey-specific feeding rates which,
in conjuction with (3) estimates of <em>prey and predator abundances</em>,
allow us characterize the functional forms of their interactions.
We have applied the approach in both stream and intertidal communities.</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        Predator feeding rates (described by their functional response) must saturate at high prey densities. Although thousands of manipulative functional response experiments show feeding rate saturation at high densities under controlled conditions, it is unclear how saturated feeding rates are at natural prey densities. The general degree of feeding rate saturation has important implications for the processes determining feeding rates and how they respond to changes in prey density. To address this, we linked two databases – one of functional response parameters and one on mass-abundance scaling – through prey mass to calculate a feeding rate saturation index. We find that: 1) feeding rates may commonly be unsaturated and 2) the degree of saturation varies with predator and prey taxonomic identities and body sizes, habitat, interaction dimension, and temperature. These results reshape our conceptualization of predator-prey interactions in nature and suggest new research on the ecological and evolutionary implications of unsaturated feeding rates.

      <div class="article-style">
        Historical resurveys of ecological communities are important for placing the structure of modern ecosystems in context. Rarely, however, are surveys alone sufficient for providing direct insight into the rates of ecological processes that underlie how communities function, either now or in the past. In this study, I used a statistically-reasoned observational approach to estimate the feeding rates of a New Zealand intertidal predator, <em>Haustrum haustorium</em>, using diet surveys performed at several sites by Robert Paine in 1968&ndash;9 and by me in 2004. Comparisons between time periods reveal a remarkable consistency in <em>Haustrum haustorium</em>&rsquo;s prey-specific feeding rates, which contrasts with the changes I observed in prey abundances, <em>Haustrum haustorium</em>&rsquo;s body size distribution, and the proportional contributions of <em>Haustrum haustorium</em>&rsquo;s prey to its apparent diet. Although these results imply accompanying and perhaps adaptive changes in	<em>Haustrum haustorium</em>&rsquo;s prey preferences, they are nonetheless anticipated by <em>Haustrum haustorium</em>&rsquo;s high range of variation in prey-specific handling times that dictate not only its maximum possible feeding rates but also the probabilities with which feeding events may be detected during diet surveys. Similarly high variation in detection times (i.e. handling and digestion times) is evident in predator species throughout the animal kingdom. The potential disconnect between a predator&rsquo;s apparent diet and its actual feeding rates suggests that much of the temporal and biogeographic variation that is perceived in predator diets and food-web structures may be of less functional consequence than currently assumed.

      <div class="article-style">
        The assessment of relative model performance using information criteria like AIC and BIC has become routine among functional-response studies, reflecting trends in the broader ecological literature. Such information criteria allow comparison across diverse models because they penalize each model’s fit by its parametric complexity — in terms of their number of free parameters — which allows simpler models to outperform similarly fitting models of higher parametric complexity. However, criteria like AIC and BIC do not consider an additional form of model complexity, referred to as geometric complexity, which relates specifically to the mathematical form of the model. Models of equivalent parametric complexity can differ in their geometric complexity and thereby in their ability to flexibly fit data. Here we use the Fisher Information Approximation criterion to compare, explain, and contextualize how geometric complexity varies across a large compilation of single-prey functional-response models — including prey-, ratio-, and predator-dependent formulations — reflecting varying levels of phenomenological generality and varying apparent degrees and forms of non-linearity. Because a model’s geometric complexity varies with the data’s underlying experimental design, we also sought to determine which designs are best at leveling the playing field among functional-response models. Our analyses illustrate (1) the large differences in geometric complexity that exist among functional-response models, (2) there is no experimental design that can minimize these differences across all models, and (3) even the qualitative nature by which some models are more or less flexible than others is reversed by changes in experimental design. Failure to appreciate geometric complexity in the empirical evaluation of functional-response models may therefore lead to biased inferences for predator-prey ecology, particularly at low experimental sample sizes where the relative effects of geometric complexity are strongest. We conclude by discussing the statistical and epistemological challenges that geometric complexity poses for the study of functional responses as it relates to the attainment of biological truth and predictive ability.

      <div class="article-style">
        Stable isotopes are increasingly being used to unlock the wealth of information contained in specimens preserved in museum collections. However, preservation methods that employ formalin may confound ecological interpretations. To quantify the effects of formalin fixation and subsequent fluid storage in ethanol on the isotopic signatures of small mammal hair, we analyzed δ13C and δ15N values from specimens of seven rodent species that were sampled repeatedly both before and after varying lengths of formalin fixation (1 – 11 days) and ethanol storage (1 – 6 years). We supplemented these data with a two-week fixation experiment using deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in which no ethanol storage was employed. As expected, preservation in formalin and ethanol had no discernable effect on δ15N values.  In contrast, specimen δ13C values decreased in a saturating fashion during formalin fixation and over subsequent years of fluid storage in ethanol.  On the basis of models that we fit to these time series, we estimate the long-term effect of fixation and storage on δ13C values to be -0.92‰ after 4 years. This biologically relevant shift in δ13C values should be accounted for when inferring the diets of species from fluid-stored museum collections and when comparing across specimens with different preservation histories.

      <div class="article-style">
        Functional responses relate a consumer&rsquo;s feeding rates to variation in its abiotic and biotic environment, providing insight into consumer behaviour and fitness, and underpinning population and food‐web dynamics. Despite their broad relevance and long‐standing history, we show here that the types of density dependence found in classic resource‐ and consumer‐dependent functional‐response models equate to strong and often untenable assumptions about the independence of processes underlying feeding rates. We first demonstrate mathematically how to quantify non‐independence between feeding and consumer interference and between feeding on multiple resources. We then analyse two large collections of functional‐response data sets to show that non‐independence is pervasive and borne out in previously hidden forms of density dependence. Our results provide a new lens through which to view variation in consumer feeding rates and disentangle the biological underpinnings of species interactions in multi‐species contexts.

      <div class="article-style">
        Theory suggests that intraspecific trait variation will alter species interaction strengths through nonlinear averaging when interaction strengths are nonlinear functions of individuals&rsquo; traits. This effect is expected to be widespread, yet what factors mediate its magnitude in nature and hence its potential effects on ecosystems and communities are unclear.
We sought to quantify how nonlinear predator functional responses, variation in prey densities and counteracting variation in attack rates and handling times among predator individuals of similar body size alter their population-level feeding rates through nonlinear averaging in a natural system, and to determine the processes influencing the net magnitude of this effect.
We used a field caging experiment in the rocky intertidal of Oregon, USA to quantify attack-rate variation and feeding rates of the whelk Nucella ostrina on its barnacle and mussel prey. We also used empirically parameterized simulations to examine the effects of handling-time variation among individuals on population-level feeding rates.
Within cages, individual attack-rate variation reduced population-level whelk feeding rates. However, the magnitude of this reduction differed among prey species and cages depending on cage-specific magnitudes of attack-rate variation and functional-response nonlinearity. The inferred effects of handling-time variation among individuals were of smaller magnitude than those of attack-rate variation, yet counteracted them to cause a net weakening of the effect of individual attack-rate variation on population-level feeding rates. Across cages, attack-rate and prey-density variation had non-additive effects that produced greater feeding-rate reductions at the experiment scale relative to the cage scale.
Our results indicate that the effects of trait variation via nonlinear averaging depend critically on the features of systems that determine the magnitudes of nonlinearities and trait variation. Because of counteracting trait variation, nonlinear-averaging effects may be quite complex, involving both the variances and covariances of all traits and environmental variables influencing the ecological process of interest.

      <div class="article-style">
        Functional responses are a cornerstone to our understanding of consumer-resource interactions, so how to best describe them using models has been actively debated. Here we focus on the consumer dependence of functional responses to evidence systematic bias in the statistical comparison of functional-response models and the estimation of their parameters. Both forms of bias are universal to nonlinear models (irrespective of consumer dependence) and are rooted in a lack of sufficient replication. Using a large compilation of published datasets, we show that ? due to the prevalence of low sample size studies ? neither the overall frequency by which alternative models achieve top rank nor the frequency distribution of parameter point estimates should be treated as providing insight into the general form or central tendency of consumer interference. We call for renewed clarity in the varied purposes that motivate the study of functional responses, purposes that can compete with each other in dictating the design, analysis and interpretation of functional-response experiments.

      <div class="article-style">
        Although parasites are increasingly recognized for their ecosystem roles, it is often assumed that free-living organisms dominate animal biomass in most ecosystems and therefore provide the primary pathways for energy transfer. To examine the contributions of parasites to ecosystem energetics in freshwater streams, we quantified the standing biomass of trematodes and free-living organisms at nine sites in three streams in western Oregon, USA. We then compared the rates of biomass flow from snails Juga plicifera into trematode parasites relative to aquatic vertebrate predators (sculpin, cutthroat trout and Pacific giant salamanders). The trematode parasite community had the fifth highest dry biomass density among stream organisms (0.40 g/m2) and exceeded the combined biomass of aquatic insects. Only host snails (3.88 g/m2), sculpin (1.11 g/m2), trout (0.73 g/m2) and crayfish (0.43 g/m2) had a greater biomass. The parasite ?extended phenotype?, consisting of trematode plus castrated host biomass, exceeded the individual biomass of every taxonomic group other than snails. The substantial parasite biomass stemmed from the high snail density and infection prevalence, and the large proportional mass of infected hosts that consisted of trematode tissue (M = 31% per snail). Estimates of yearly biomass transfer from snails into trematodes were slightly higher than the combined estimate of snail biomass transfer into the three vertebrate predators. Pacific giant salamanders accounted for 90% of the snail biomass consumed by predators. These results demonstrate that trematode parasites play underappreciated roles in the ecosystem energetics of some freshwater streams.

        Species interactions in food webs are usually recognized as dynamic, varying across species, space, and time because of biotic and abiotic drivers. Yet food webs also show emergent properties that appear consistent, such as a skewed frequency distribution of interaction strengths (many weak, few strong). Reconciling these two properties requires an understanding of the variation in pairwise interaction strengths and its underlying mechanisms. We estimated stream sculpin feeding rates in three seasons at nine sites in Oregon to examine variation in trophic interaction strengths both across and within predator–prey pairs. Predator and prey densities, prey body mass, and abiotic factors were considered as putative drivers of within‐pair variation over space and time. We hypothesized that consistently skewed interaction strength distributions could result if individual interaction strengths show relatively little variation, or alternatively, if interaction strengths vary but shift in ways that conserve their overall frequency distribution. Feeding rate distributions remained consistently and positively skewed across all sites and seasons. The mean coefficient of variation in feeding rates within each of 25 focal species pairs across surveys was less than half the mean coefficient of variation seen across species pairs within a survey. The rank order of feeding rates also remained conserved across streams, seasons and individual surveys. On average, feeding rates on each prey taxon nonetheless varied by a hundredfold, with some feeding rates showing more variation in space and others in time. In general, feeding rates increased with prey density and decreased with high stream flows and low water temperatures, although for nearly half of all species pairs, factors other than prey density explained the most variation. Our findings show that although individual interaction strengths exhibit considerable variation in space and time, they can nonetheless remain relatively consistent, and thus predictable, compared to the even larger variation that occurs across species pairs. These results highlight how the ecological scale of inference can strongly shape conclusions about interaction strength consistency and help reconcile how the skewed nature of interaction strength distributions can persist in highly dynamic food webs.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>Diet variation among individuals within populations is widespread. Often diet dierences among individuals are attributable to obvious differences among individuals such as age, sex, or morphology. However, growing evidence suggests that individual diet variation is also common among seemingly identical individuals within populations. This phenomenon has been termed individual diet specialization. Individual diet specialization has been documented across a variety of taxa and biomes and theory suggests that diet specialization can potentially alter the structure and strength of predator-prey interactions. This raises two important questions: 1) What are the causes of individual diet specialization?, and 2) What are the potential consequences of diet specialization for populations and communities? In this dissertation, I attempt to address these two questions by combining mathematical theory, the novel application of statistical methods, and field and laboratory experiments with the intertidal whelk, Nucella ostrina.</p>
<p>A potential ultimate cause of variation among individuals is disruptive selection in which natural selection favors individuals with more extreme trait values over individuals with intermediate trait values. Theory has suggested that the availability of alternative resources and intraspecific competition for those resources can drive disruptive selection in consumers and lead to increased diet variation. However, this theory makes several ecologically unrealistic assumptions. In particular, this theory assumes that consumers have linear functional responses and that the trait of the consumer under selection only influences the consumer’s attack rates on resources. In Chapter 2, I alleviate these assumptions and show that nonlinear functional responses and traits influencing multiple functional response parameters simultaneously can influence the strength and likelihood of disruptive selection. My results suggest the characteristics of consumers in which disrup- tive selection in resource-use traits may occur and diet specialization through this mechanism may be most likely.</p>
<p>To empirically evaluate hypotheses on the causes and consequences of individ- ual diet specialization, we need to be able to accurately quantify diet specialization. In Chapter 3, I apply Bayesian hierarchical models to the problem of estimating diet specialization and compare the performance of the Bayesian hierarchical models to currently used methods for estimating diet specialization. Currently used methods infer individual prey preferences using the observed proportion of prey in individuals’ diets whereas the Bayesian hierarchical models instead estimate these proportions. I find that the currently used approach tends to overestimate diet specialization compared to the Bayesian hierarchical approach. This is especially the case when sample sizes per individual are low or heterogeneous. In addition, the Bayesian hierarchical approach provides estimates of prey proportions, their variability, and the uncertainty on these estimates in ways that are inaccessible to current methods. These results suggest that the Bayesian hierarchical method can provide an improved method for quantifying diet specialization.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, I present the results from a field caging experiment examining the proximate ecological mechanisms determining individual diet specialization and its consequences in the intertidal whelk, Nucella ostrina. Many of the hypotheses on the ecological causes of diet specialization assume that individuals differ from one another in their prey preferences. However, these hypotheses ignore the potential influence of stochasticity in the foraging process in generating diet variation among individuals. The results of this chapter suggest that changes in the magnitude of diet variation with changes in prey community composition in Nucella ostrina can largely be explained by stochastic foraging by individuals with shared prey pref- erences. In this chapter, I also estimate the consequences of this diet variation for estimates of predator feeding rates through nonlinear averaging (Jensen’s inequality) of predator attack rates. The results suggest that nonlinear averaging alters the perceived strength of predator-prey interactions in this system providing one of the first empirical estimates of the potential consequences of diet variation.</p>
<p>Overall, my dissertation provides several insights into the potential causes of diet specialization, provides one of the first empirical estimates of a possibly widespread consequence of diet specialization for populations and communities, and suggests improved statistical methodology for quantifying diet specialization. I believe that this dissertation will lead to a critical assessment of definitions of individual diet specialization, provide guidance towards systems in which diet specialization is the most likely to occur, and encourage further empirical research estimating the e↵ects of diet specialization on populations and communities.</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        Describing the mechanisms that drive variation in species interaction strengths is central to understanding, predicting, and managing community dynamics. Multiple factors have been linked to trophic interaction strength variation, including species densities, species traits, and abiotic factors. Yet most empirical tests of the relative roles of multiple mechanisms that drive variation have been limited to simplified experiments that may diverge from the dynamics of natural food webs. Here, we used a field-based observational approach to quantify the roles of prey density, predator density, predator-prey body-mass ratios, prey identity, and abiotic factors in driving variation in feeding rates of reticulate sculpin (Cottus perplexus). We combined data on over 6,000 predator-prey observations with prey identification time functions to estimate 289 prey-specific feeding rates at nine stream sites in Oregon. Feeding rates on 57 prey types showed an approximately log-normal distribution, with few strong and many weak interactions. Model selection indicated that prey density, followed by prey identity, were the two most important predictors of prey-specific sculpin feeding rates. Feeding rates showed a positive relationship with prey taxon densities that was inconsistent with predator saturation predicted by current functional response models. Feeding rates also exhibited four orders-of-magnitude in variation across prey taxonomic orders, with the lowest feeding rates observed on prey with significant anti-predator defenses. Body-mass ratios were the third most important predictor variable, showing a hump-shaped relationship with the highest feeding rates at intermediate ratios. Sculpin density was negatively correlated with feeding rates, consistent with the presence of intraspecific predator interference. Our results highlight how multiple co-occurring drivers shape trophic interactions in nature and underscore ways in which simplified experiments or reliance on scaling laws alone may lead to biased inferences about the structure and dynamics of species-rich food webs.

      <div class="article-style">
        Considerable effort has been devoted to the estimation of species interaction strengths. This effort has focused primarily on statistical significance testing and obtaining point estimates of parameters that contribute to interaction strength magnitudes, leaving the characterization of uncertainty associated with those estimates unconsidered. We consider a means of characterizing the uncertainty of a generalist predator’s interaction strengths by formulating an observational method for estimating a predator’s prey-specific per capita attack rates as a Bayesian statistical model. This formulation permits the explicit incorporation of multiple sources of uncertainty. A key insight is the informative nature of several so-called non-informative priors that have been used in modeling the sparse data typical of predator feeding surveys. We introduce to ecology a new neutral prior and provide evidence for its superior performance. We use a case study to consider the attack rates in a New Zealand intertidal whelk predator, and we illustrate not only that Bayesian point estimates can be made to correspond with those obtained by frequentist approaches, but also that estimation uncertainty as described by 95% intervals is more useful and biologically realistic using the Bayesian method. In particular, unlike in bootstrap confidence intervals, the lower bounds of the Bayesian posterior intervals for attack rates do not include zero when a predator–prey interaction is in fact observed. We conclude that the Bayesian framework provides a straightforward, probabilistic characterization of interaction strength uncertainty, enabling future considerations of both the deterministic and stochastic drivers of interaction strength and their impact on food webs.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>Parasites are increasingly recognized for their significant roles in shaping community structure and ecosystem dynamics. Due to their cryptic nature, however, they are often neglected in measurements of energy flow and biomass in ecosystems. Past studies have demonstrated that parasites directly contribute to the flow of energy through marine estuaries and freshwater wetlands, yet it remains unknown how broadly applicable these findings are across other ecosystems. The aim of our study was to quantify the role of trematode parasites in the flow of energy through freshwater streams, using biomass as a proxy for energy flow. To accomplish this, we quantified the density and size distributions of aquatic organisms using quadrat and surber samplers within three Oregon steams (n = 9 field sites total) during the summer months. We then used length-to-mass regressions to estimate the free-living biomass of each organism per unit area. To estimate trematode biomass, we dissected freshwater snail hosts, Juga plicifera, quantifying infection prevalence and trematode mass as a function of host body size for each trematode taxon. </p>
<p>Juga snails dominated the standing crop biomass of aquatic invertebrates, constituting an average of 87.5% of the total invertebrate biomass across the three streams (mean = 3.77 g m2). The other most important groups included Coleoptera (0.0315 g m2), Plecoptera (0.0138 g m2), Trichoptera (0.0129 g m2), and Odonata (0.0128 g m2). We identified five trematode taxa that infected Juga snails at our field sites (Metagonimoides oregonensis, Nanophyetus salmincola, Acanthatrium oregonense, Derogenidae spp., and Opecoilidae spp.). Trematode tissue comprised an average of 31% of the total body mass of each infected snail at the individual level, with a positive correlation between snail size and percent trematode mass. Trematode biomass ranged from 4% to 17% of the total population-level snail biomass, averaging 0.392 g m2 across the sites. Trematode biomass exceeded all taxon-specific and total free-living insect biomass (mean = 0.096 g m2). Our results suggest that trematodes are capable of surpassing the roles of many major free-living invertebrates in the movement of energy through these stream food webs. Furthermore, because few aquatic predators consume Juga snails, trematodes potentially alter pathways of energy flow by routing snail production through parasites and into other components of the aquatic food web.</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        In diverse tropical webs, trophic cascades are presumed to be rare, as species interactions may dampen top-down control and reduce their prevalence. To test this hypothesis, we used an open experimental design in the Galápagos rocky subtidal that enabled a diverse guild of fish species, in the presence of each other and top predators (sea lions and sharks), to attack two species of sea urchins grazing on benthic algae. Time-lapse photography of experiments on natural and experimental substrates revealed strong species identity effects: only two predator species–blunthead triggerfish (Pseudobalistes naufragium) and finescale triggerfish (Balistes polylepis)–drove a diurnal trophic cascade extending to algae, and they preferred large pencil urchins (Eucidaris galapagensis) over green urchins (Lytechinus semituberculatus). Triggerfish predation effects were strong, causing a 24-fold reduction of pencil urchin densities during the initial 21 hours of a trophic cascade experiment. A trophic cascade was demonstrated for pencil urchins, but not for green urchins, by significantly higher percent cover of urchin-grazed algae in cages that excluded predatory fish than in predator access (fence) treatments. Pencil urchins were more abundant at night when triggerfish were absent, suggesting that this species persists by exploiting a nocturnal predation refuge. Time-series of pencil urchin survivorship further demonstrated per capita interference effects of hogfish and top predators. These interference effects respectively weakened and extended the trophic cascade to a fourth trophic level through behavioral modifications of the triggerfish-urchin interaction. We conclude that interference behaviors capable of modifying interaction strength warrant greater attention as mechanisms for altering top-down control, particularly in speciose food webs.

      <div class="article-style">
        A long‐standing debate concerns how functional responses are best described. Theory suggests that ratio dependence is consistent with many food web patterns left unexplained by the simplest prey‐dependent models. However, for logistical reasons, ratio dependence and predator dependence more generally have seen infrequent empirical evaluation and then only so in specialist predators, which are rare in nature. Here we develop an approach to simultaneously estimate the prey‐specific attack rates and predator‐specific interference (facilitation) rates of predators interacting with arbitrary numbers of prey and predator species in the field. We apply the approach to surveys and experiments involving two intertidal whelks and their full suite of potential prey. Our study provides strong evidence for predator dependence that is poorly described by the ratio dependent model over manipulated and natural ranges of species abundances. It also indicates how, for generalist predators, even the qualitative nature of predator dependence can be prey‐specific.

      <div class="article-style">
        Intraspecific variation in ecologically relevant traits is widespread. In generalist predators in particular, individual diet specialization is likely to have important consequences for food webs. Understanding individual diet specialization empirically requires the ability to quantify individual diet preferences accurately. Here we compare the currently used frequentist maximum likelihood approach, which infers individual preferences using the observed prey proportions to Bayesian hierarchical models that instead estimate these proportions. Using simulated and empirical data, we find that the approach of using observed prey proportions consistently overestimates diet specialization relative to the Bayesian hierarchical approach when the number of prey observations per individual is low or the number of prey observations vary among individuals, two common features of empirical data. Furthermore, the Bayesian hierarchical approach permits the estimation of point estimates for both prey proportions and their variability within and among levels of organization (i.e., individuals, experimental treatments, populations), while also characterizing the uncertainty of these estimates in ways inaccessible to frequentist methods. The Bayesian hierarchical approach provides a useful framework for improving the quantification and understanding of intraspecific variation in diet specialization studies.

      <div class="article-style">
        Estimates of predator feeding rates are important for understanding trophic dynamics. One common method for quantifying feeding rates in fishes combines mass‐based diet data with gastric evacuation times to estimate prey mass consumed per predator. An alternative approach is to estimate the rates of prey individuals consumed using prey identification time—the time period over which prey remain identifiable in a predator&rsquo;s stomach. One challenge with the analysis of prey identification times, however, is that the response variable is likely to be censored because the “true” prey identification time cannot be observed directly. Here, we applied survival analysis that can incorporate censored data to estimate the effects of predator body size, water temperature, and prey characteristics (type, count, and body size) on identification times in Reticulate Sculpin Cottus perplexus. We focused on seven types of prey that are common in this generalist predator&rsquo;s diet: mayflies (Ephemeroptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), true flies (Diptera), beetles (Coleoptera), worms (Annelida), and sculpin eggs. An information‐theoretic model comparison approach indicated that an accelerated failure time Weibull model with all five covariates provided the best relative fit to the full data set. Prey type had a strong effect on prey identification time, with annelid worms having the shortest times (&lt;1 h) and caddisflies having the longest times (&gt;15 h). Water temperature decreased prey identification time (7.5% per 1°C increase), whereas prey count (i.e., meal size) increased prey identification time (15.5% per additional prey item). Predator body size had a weak negative effect on prey identification time (0.04% per 1‐mm increase). Body sizes of some prey taxa, including mayflies, caddisflies, and stoneflies, increased prey identification times, leading to an interaction between prey type and prey size. Our study highlights the utility of survival analysis for quantifying variation in prey identification times in the diets of generalist predators.

      <div class="article-style">
        The community matrix is among ecology&rsquo;s most important mathematical abstractions, formally encapsulating the interconnected network of effects that species have on one another&rsquo;s populations. Despite its importance, the term “community matrix” has been applied to multiple types of matrices that have differing interpretations. This has hindered the application of theory for understanding community structure and perturbation responses. Here, we clarify the correspondence and distinctions among the Interaction matrix, the Alpha matrix, and the Jacobian matrix, terms that are frequently used interchangeably as well as synonymously with the term “community matrix.” We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed. Our synthesis highlights the empirical challenges that remain in using these tools to understand actual communities.

      <div class="article-style">
        Understanding ecological interaction strengths is one of the main objectives of ecology. Recently, two methods for estimating interaction strengths of predator- prey interactions in nature have been proposed: a field observation approach proposed by Novak and Wootton (2008) and stable isotope analysis. The field observation method estimates feeding rates based on feeding observations, handling times and prey abundances. Stable isotope analysis estimates diet proportions using mixing models of ratios of heavy to light carbon and nitrogen isotopes in body tissues of predators and their prey. However, because these two methods are relatively new, few studies have been conducted to understand and contrast their estimates of interaction strengths. I sought to quantify the correlation between the estimates of interaction strength made by the two methods. Both methods were conducted simultaneously in a rocky intertidal community on the Oregon coast with the whelk Nucella ostrina as the focal predator and the barnacle Balanus glandula and the mussel Mytilus trossulus as the two primary prey species. I documented a non-significant and weak correlation between the two method’s estimates of interaction strength. I hypothesize that this lack of correspondence between the methods may be explained by abnormal δ13C enrichment in the whelks compared to their prey, and a lack of variation in observed predator diets between replicate sample populations.

      <div class="article-style">
        Intraguild predation theory centres on two predictions: (i) for an omnivore and an intermediate predator (IG-prey) to coexist on shared resources, the IG-prey must be the superior resource competitor, and (ii) increasing resource productivity causes the IG-prey&rsquo;s equilibrium abundance to decline. I tested these predictions with a series of species-rich food webs along New Zealand&rsquo;s rocky shores, focusing on two predatory whelks, <em>Haustrum haustorium</em>, a trophic omnivore, and <em>Haustrum scobina</em>, the IG-prey. In contrast to theory, the IG-prey&rsquo;s abundance increased with productivity. Furthermore, feeding rates and allometric considerations indicate a competitive advantage for the omnivore when non-shared prey are considered, despite the IG-prey&rsquo;s superiority for shared prey. Nevertheless, clear and regular cross-gradient changes in network structure and interaction strengths were observed that challenge the assumptions of current theory. These insights suggest that the consideration of consumer-dependent functional responses, non-equilibrium dynamics, the dynamic nature of prey choice and non-trophic interactions among basal prey will be fruitful avenues for theoretical development.

      <div class="article-style">
        Patterns of species interactions affect the dynamics of food webs. An important component of species interactions that is rarely considered with respect to food webs is the strengths of interactions, which may affect both structure and dynamics. In natural systems, these strengths are variable, and can be quantified as probability distributions. We examined how variation in strengths of interactions can be described hierarchically, and how this variation impacts the structure of species interactions in predator–prey networks, both of which are important components of ecological food webs. The stable isotope ratios of predator and prey species may be particularly useful for quantifying this variability, and we show how these data can be used to build probabilistic predator–prey networks. Moreover, the distribution of variation in strengths among interactions can be estimated from a limited number of observations. This distribution informs network structure, especially the key role of dietary specialization, which may be useful for predicting structural properties in systems that are difficult to observe. Finally, using three mammalian predator–prey networks (two African and one Canadian) quantified from stable isotope data, we show that exclusion of link-strength variability results in biased estimates of nestedness and modularity within food webs, whereas the inclusion of body size constraints only marginally increases the predictive accuracy of the isotope-based network. We find that modularity is the consequence of strong link-strengths in both African systems, while nestedness is not significantly present in any of the three predator–prey networks.

      <div class="article-style">
        Predators sometimes provide biotic resistance against invasions by nonnative prey. Understanding and predicting the strength of biotic resistance remains a key challenge in invasion biology. A predator&rsquo;s functional response to nonnative prey may predict whether a predator can provide biotic resistance against nonnative prey at different prey densities. Surprisingly, functional responses have not been used to make quantitative predictions about biotic resistance. We parameterized the functional response of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) to invasive New Zealand mud snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum; NZMS) and used this functional response and a simple model of NZMS population growth to predict the probability of biotic resistance at different predator and prey densities. Signal crayfish were effective predators of NZMS, consuming more than 900 NZMS per predator in a 12‐h period, and Bayesian model fitting indicated their consumption rate followed a type 3 functional response to NZMS density. Based on this functional response and associated parameter uncertainty, we predict that NZMS will be able to invade new systems at low crayfish densities (&lt;0.2 crayfish/m2) regardless of NZMS density. At intermediate to high crayfish densities (&gt;0.2 crayfish/m2), we predict that low densities of NZMS will be able to establish in new communities; however, once NZMS reach a threshold density of ∼2000 NZMS/m2, predation by crayfish will drive negative NZMS population growth. Further, at very high densities, NZMS overwhelm predation by crayfish and invade. Thus, interacting thresholds of propagule pressure and predator densities define the probability of biotic resistance. Quantifying the shape and uncertainty of predator functional responses to nonnative prey may help predict the outcomes of invasions.

      <div class="article-style">
        Bayesian mixing models have allowed for the inclusion of uncertainty and prior information in the analysis of trophic interactions using stable isotopes. Formulating prior distributions is relatively straightforward when incorporating dietary data. However, the use of data that are related, but not directly proportional, to diet (such as prey availability data) is often problematic because such information is not necessarily predictive of diet, and the information required to build a reliable prior distribution for all prey species is often unavailable. Omitting prey availability data impacts the estimation of a predator&rsquo;s diet and introduces the strong assumption of consumer ultrageneralism (where all prey are consumed in equal proportions), particularly when multiple prey have similar isotope values.

      <div class="article-style">
        The complexity of food webs poses a significant hurdle for our growing understanding of the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. Empirical methods that measure the per capita strengths of trophic species interactions offer a means to identify keystone species and bridge mathematical models and data to synthesize our knowledge of population dynamics and predator feeding behaviors. Many such methods have been proposed, but few have seen independent validation of their estimates or underlying assumptions. This is particularly so with respect to the nonlinear functional responses by which predators often respond to their prey. Here I describe an empirical test of a recently proposed observational method for estimating the nonlinear strength of predator–prey interactions in the field. By applying the method to two populations of a predatory intertidal whelk, Haustrum scobina, I estimated its per capita attack rates on all nine of its observed prey species. These spanned two orders of magnitude in per capita strength. Concurrent experimental manipulations of the two predator populations provided population time series for the response of a mussel prey species, Xenostrobus pulex. I obtained independent interaction strength estimates for this focal interaction by fitting a sequence of hypothesized predator–prey models to these time series. Overall, site‐specific models assuming linear functional responses performed better than all others. A direct comparison of the attack‐rate estimates from the observational method with those of the best‐performing nonlinear model nevertheless revealed high concordance between the two methods. The results of this study therefore support the use of the observational method in larger and more complex food webs and suggest that trophic interactions in the range of mean prey densities observed in nature are approximately linear.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>Few methods for demonstrating the effects of species interactions rival that of the manipulative experiment (Kareiva and Levin 2002). The now commonly performed removal or addition of predators, competitors, or mutualists to experimentally replicated populations of recipient species has irrefutably shown that species can have important effects on each other&rsquo;s populations, and that the strengths of these effects can vary considerably across environmental contexts and species identities. A large body of research is directed towards understanding this variation to forecast community dynamics and dissect how species interactions regulate community structure (Chesson 2000, McCann 2000, Stachowicz 2001, Duffy 2002). It has frequently been pointed out that progress in this field will require more explicit connections between ecological theory and the realities of nature (Laska and Wootton 1998, Parker et al. 1999, Berlow et al. 2004, Agrawal et al. 2007). This requires that interaction strengths measured experimentally be appropriate to the biology of our study systems and the mathematical abstractions we ascribe to them.</p>
<p>Here we clarify some of the assumptions made in the application of the two most commonly used indices for measuring the strengths of species interactions with manipulative removal/addition experiments: Paine&rsquo;s index and the dynamic index. We explain how the values these indices are intended to measure – the per capita interaction strength between two species – are typically not estimated in common currencies. We then introduce extensions to these indices that alleviate a subset of previously made assumptions and limitations. These include a reformulation of Paine&rsquo;s index appropriate for an open‐recruitment system, and an extension of the dynamic index applicable to interactions of a particular nonlinear form. While we focus our language on predator–prey interactions, our discussions are pertinent to the measurement of species effects in other types of interactions as well (Mitchell and Wass 1996, Freckleton et al. 2009).</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        Efforts to estimate the strength of species interactions in species‐rich, reticulate food webs have been hampered by the multitude of direct and indirect interactions such systems exhibit and have been limited by an assumption that pairwise interactions display linear functional forms. Here we present a new method for directly measuring, on a per capita basis, the nonlinear strength of trophic species interactions within such food webs. This is an observation‐based method, requiring three pieces of information: (1) species abundances, (2) predator and prey‐specific handling times, and (3) data from predator‐specific feeding surveys in which the number of individuals observed feeding on each of the predator&rsquo;s prey species has been tallied. The method offers a straightforward way to assess the completeness of one&rsquo;s sampling effort in accurately estimating interaction strengths through the construction of predator‐specific prey accumulation curves. The method should be applicable to a variety of systems in which empirical estimates of direct interaction strengths have thus far remained elusive.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>Two elements of food webs add significantly to their complexity:  The presence of trophic omnivores and the nonlinear nature of predator-prey interactions. I introduce a new observational method for estimating the strengths of species interactions that accounts for the indeterminacy of omnivorous indirect effects and the saturating functional responses that predators exhibit. I present an empirical validation of the method’s accuracy by applying it to two populations of the predatory whelk, Haustrum (= Lepsiella) scobina, that is common to the rocky intertidal shores of New Zealand, and comparing these interaction strength estimates with those derived from concurrently performed experimental manipulations of H. scobina’s populations.</p>
<p>I then test two key predictions of intraguild predation theory by investigating how species abundances, food web structure and species interactions strengths change across six omnivorous food webs along a gradient of productivity present around New Zealand’s coastline. I find that the intermediate predator, H. scobina, is the superior competitor for shared prey species, as predicted by theory.  Counter to theory, however, I show that it is the omnivorous whelk, H. haustorium, that is the superior competitor when all prey are considered, and that H. scobina’s abundance increases with increasing productivity. My analyses nevertheless reveal clear and regular cross-gradient shifts in interactions that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, I ask to what degree whelk feeding rates are saturated with respect to prey densities and, by extending and parameterizing the classic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, ask whether empirical interactions are nonlinear enough to affect the stability of whelk-prey dynamics. Results indicate that whelk feeding rates are not strongly saturated and that increasing diet richness has a non-additive effect on a predator’s saturation such that alternative prey have a stabilizing effect on whelk-prey dynamics.  I thereby offer a new mechanism by which generalist predators stabilize the dynamics of their species-rich food webs that does not invoke prey switching.</p>
<p>My dissertation brings empirical data to bear on the importance of omnivory and the nonlinear nature of trophic interactions. Furthering our understanding of these food web features can contribute much to both the conceptual and applied goals of ecology.</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        The patterns of diel activity of four large decapod species in the shallow subtidal of the Isles of Shoals, Gulf of Maine, U.S.A. were investigated. During the summer of 1999 the diel abundance and size distribution of active decapod individuals were surveyed at three depth ranges at a sheltered site on Appledore Island. Densities of active American lobsters, <em>Homarus americanus</em> H. Milne Edwards, 1837, were, as expected, highest at night. The crabs <em>Cancer borealis</em> Stimpson, 1859 and <em>Carcinus maenas</em> (L., 1758), however, were almost exclusively active during the day. <em>Cancer irroratus</em> Say, 1817 were equally active during the day and the night, but the mean size of individuals was significantly larger during the day. Surveys at additional sites in 2003 confirmed that these same patterns of diel activity were present throughout the Isles of Shoals. An extensive review of the literature suggests that such diurnal activity is not only unusual for the three crab species of this study, but for the whole genus Cancer as well.

      <div class="article-style">
        On the rocky shores of the Gulf of Maine, the American lobster, Homarus americanus, the Jonah crab, Cancer borealis, the Rock crab, Cancer irroratus, and the Green crab, Carcinus maenas, compose a guild of highly mobile predators. Although the species are potential competitors that consume the same prey and utilize the same shelters, lobsters also prey on crabs (i.e., lobsters are intraguild predators of crabs). During daytime low tides, crabs are also preyed upon by Larus spp. gulls. In this study, I investigated the importance of avian and intraguild predation in influencing the diel and spatial (depth) patterns of decapod activity in the algal-covered lower intertidal and subtidal zones of Appledore Island, Maine, USA. During the summer months of 1999, the diel abundance and size distribution of active individuals was measured at several depths for each decapod species. Densities of active lobsters were highest at night and did not vary with depth. Contrary to prevailing knowledge, C. borealis and C. maenas were active almost exclusively during the day. While diurnal C. borealis were significantly more abundant in the deepest zone (9-11 m), C. maenas was not found at this depth and was most abundant in the shallowest zone (0-1 m). Day and night C. irroratus densities were not significantly different and showed no significant variation with depth. Only C. irroratus populations exhibited a diel difference in the mean size of individual crabs. The mean size of individuals observed during the day was larger than those observed at night. During the day, C. borealis were larger at depths of 9-11 m than at depths of 1-3 m, while C. maenas crabs were larger at depths of 5-7 m than at depths of 0-1 m.
The magnitude of avian predation was assessed by censuses of crab remains collected in the intertidal during periods of low tide. Results reinforce previous studies in suggesting that gulls are a major factor limiting the upper distribution of C. borealis. In the subtidal, the relative availability of potential shelters does not appear to account for the depth distributions observed among the species. The presence of a potentially sheltering Codium algal canopy at 1 to 7 m may be important for C. maenas and C. irroratus. A subtidal tethering experiment with C. borealis and C. irroratus revealed no diel or depth differences in crab survival. Overall, rates of predation were very low, but were significantly higher for small than for large crabs. Besides lobsters, no other predators were observed at the study site; predation on tethered crabs was therefore attributed to lobsters. In laboratory experiments exposing pairs of small and large C. borealis and C. irroratus to lobsters, small crabs were shown to be significantly more vulnerable to predation than large conspecifics; C. borealis and C. irroratus of similar size were equally vulnerable. Large crabs, however, were attacked 71 times more often than were small crabs. The results of this study reinforce concerns that traditional models of rocky shore community organization must be amended to include mobile predators. They indicate that competitive interactions between small crabs and lobsters may be unimportant relative to intraguild predation. For large crabs, perceived nocturnal intraguild predation pressures may be just as important as competitive interactions between guild members, especially in the recent absence of predatory fishes. These results underline the importance of understanding the ecological history of the community. They suggest that the overfishing of coastal fish populations has increased the relative importance of intraguild interactions and has thereby indirectly strengthened the link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
