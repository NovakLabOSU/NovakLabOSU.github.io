      <div class="article-style">
        The factors that determine why ecosystems exhibit abrupt shifts in state are of paramount importance for management, conservation, and restoration efforts. Kelp forests are emblematic of such abruptly shifting ecosystems, transitioning from kelp-dominated to urchin-dominated states around the world with increasing frequency, yet the underlying processes and mechanisms that control their dynamics remain unclear. Here, we analyze four decades of data from biannual monitoring around San Nicolas Island, CA, USA, to show that substrate complexity controls both the number of possible (alternative) states and the velocity with which shifts between states occur. The superposition of community dynamics with reconstructions of system stability landscapes reveals that shifts between alternative states at low-complexity sites reflect abrupt, high-velocity events initiated by pulse perturbations that rapidly propel species across dynamically unstable state-space. In contrast, high-complexity sites exhibit a single state of resilient kelp-urchin coexistence.  Our analyses suggest that substrate complexity influences both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes in kelp forests, highlight its influence on kelp-forest stability at both large (island-wide) and small (&lt;10 meter) spatial scales, and could be valuable for holistic kelp-forest management.

      <div class="article-style">
        How the direct and indirect effects of species interactions cascade to affect community struc- ture, functioning, and stability is a fundamental question in ecology. In temperate kelp forests, species interactions, in conjunction with environmental processes, produce rich spatiotemporal dy- namics. Arguably the most dramatic of these are abrupt shifts in community state, where forested locations are grazed by herbivorous urchins to establish what is known as an “urchin barren”. The increasing frequency and intensity of perturbation events associated with climate change have in- creased the frequency of shifts towards the barren-state. Understanding not only the mechanisms precipitating state shifts but also those that stabilize both the forested and barren states is essential to guide effective kelp-forest conservation and management strategies. Central to urchin barren establishment is a switch in behavior, where urchins leave cracks and crevices to move across the seafloor and graze upon kelp. While it is known that urchin predators can control urchin density and behavior, it is less clear how resource availability affects urchin behavior, or how the switch in behavior affects kelp-forest dynamics at large. This dissertation evaluated urchin behavior, the “bottom-up” processes controlling it, and the subsequent effects upon kelp-forest dynamics and stability from three distinct directions.
In Chapter 2, I analyzed 38 years of kelp-forest community data and found distinct spatiotem- poral patterns: certain sites exhibited abrupt shifts in state, others exhibited resilient kelp-forest persistence. I suggest that substrate complexity (the rugosity of the benthic substrate) modified both “top-down” and “bottom-up” processes regulating urchin density and behavior. In particular, I suggest that substrate complexity altered the retention of drift algae (also known as kelp detritus, and henceforth, drift)—the senescent form of kelp that has detached from the seafloor. Urchins are believed to prefer drift, such that when drift is abundant urchin remain inactive, consume the drift, and do not graze live kelp. Variation in the retention of drift may thus in-part be responsible for the urchin behavioral switch that leads to the establishment and stabilization of the barren state.
In Chapter 3, I used a one-consumer (urchins) two-resource (kelp and drift) model to test if and how a switch in urchin grazing can precipitate kelp-forest dynamics such as alternative stable states and the emergence of kelp population cycles. Under the assumption that urchins prefer drift over live kelp, results demonstrated that all shifts in state are associated with urchins switching between resources.
In Chapter 4, I experimentally tested the core assumption from Chapter 3, i.e., that urchins “prefer” drift. Specifically, I used a subtidal caging experiment to evaluate the density-dependent effects of drift and kelp upon urchin consumption rates. Results demonstrated a strong preference in urchins to consume drift, that kelp consumption is controlled by the availability of drift (not by kelp itself), and that urchins exhibit a rank switch—a switch in the proportion of resources consumed as total biomass increases—from kelp to drift.
Altogether, this dissertation used long-term monitoring, dynamical modeling, and subtidal experimentation to evaluate the influence of grazer-resource behavior, interactions, and feedbacks upon kelp-forest dynamics and stability. While urchin predators are predominantly thought to control the switch in urchin behavior, I demonstrate how resource availability can also control this behavioral switch. This may help explain shifts to the urchin barren state at locations where urchin predator abundances remain unchanged. Furthermore, my inferences involving substrate complexity and drift as a preferred urchin resource point towards potential strategies with which to conserve or restore kelp-forest ecosystems.

      <div class="article-style">
        A major goal of the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) has been to understand the impacts of climate change and variability on the coastal ecosystems of the inner shelf of the California Current Large Marine System in particular, and other marine and even nonmarine systems more generally. Insights can result from determination of impacts of climatic perturbations such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, as well as impacts of climate-related surprises on populations, communities, and ecosystems. To gain insight into warming impacts at organismal levels, we also investigated mechanistic suborganismal (physiological, molecular) responses to thermal conditions. Warmer water was connected to changes in ecological subsidies, growth of dominant space occupiers (mussels and barnacles), and heightened physiological stress impacts. Fortuitously, PISCO researchers were ideally positioned to document ecosystem vulnerability and resilience to an unprecedented ecological surprise—coast-wide collapse of keystone predator (sea star) populations—and to investigate its consequences. As these examples suggest, long-term sampling is critically important for helping society anticipate and adapt to present and future disruptions caused by global change.

      <div class="article-style">
        As the reality of climate change became obvious during the late 1900s, the need for understanding ecosystem pattern and dynamics at large scales and for long periods became increasingly evident. This realization inspired the genesis of the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO). PISCO research aimed to quantify intertidal and subtidal biogeographic patterns of community structure and ecological subsidies, create a mooring network to document inner-shelf oceanic conditions, and conduct coordinated, coast-wide experiments testing hypotheses on the relative influences of top-down, bottom-up, non-trophic, and ecological subsidy processes. To date, insights include (1) at large scales, bottom-up and related processes drive species interactions and thereby dominate in structuring benthic communities, (2) local-to-latitudinal variation in these processes is ultimately determined by upwelling interacting with coastal geomorphology, and (3) these and similar systems are thus prime examples of “meta-ecosystems” or local-scale ecosystems that are linked by flows of propagules, particulates, and nutrients.

      <div class="article-style">
        To support conservation practices, societal demand for understanding fundamental coastal ocean ecosystem mechanisms has grown in recent decades. Globally, these regions are among the world’s most productive, but they are highly vulnerable to extractive and non-extractive stresses. In 1999, we established the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) to perform basic and use-inspired, long-term ecological research at local to large marine ecosystem (LME) scales. Coordinated investigations of ecosystem patterns and dynamics focused on nearshore coastal waters and hard-bottom habitats (rocky intertidal and kelp forests) in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Communicating relevant scientific discoveries to inform decision-making was an integral component, as was commitment to training new generations of interdisciplinary marine scientists, thereby building scientific capacity and expertise in marine conservation science and policy. Issues of climate change and ocean acidification, wildlife disease outbreaks, oil spills, and conservation strategies such as marine protected areas have spotlighted the immense value of long-term monitoring and research at the LME scale. Here, we reflect on PISCO’s approach and progress in linking science, conservation, management, and policy using 20 years of experience in the formation and operation of this research network.

      <div class="article-style">
        Despite progressive policies and continued advances in ocean management, numerous shifts associated with global changes have been observed in marine ecosystems in recent years, including warming, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation. As global change accelerates, science is needed to inform evidence-based management strategies for continued ecosystem services. Resilience management, in which actions are undertaken to promote the resistance and recovery responses of populations and ecosystems to disturbance, has been suggested as a possible strategy. However, empirical evidence for effective resilience management is still limited. To inform effective management strategies, mechanisms that underlie resilience to global change that can be influenced by management-ready actions must be identified and tested through observations, experiments, and modeling. Here, we discuss the potential links between three common management strategies (i.e., spatial restrictions such as marine protected areas, coordinated spatial protections, and fisheries management approaches) and potential mechanisms of resilience for marine populations and ecosystems, and provide guidance for future research on resilience management for a changing ocean drawing on insight gained by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans’ work at the science-policy interface in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem.

      <div class="article-style">
        In diverse tropical webs, trophic cascades are presumed to be rare, as species interactions may dampen top-down control and reduce their prevalence. To test this hypothesis, we used an open experimental design in the Galápagos rocky subtidal that enabled a diverse guild of fish species, in the presence of each other and top predators (sea lions and sharks), to attack two species of sea urchins grazing on benthic algae. Time-lapse photography of experiments on natural and experimental substrates revealed strong species identity effects: only two predator species–blunthead triggerfish (Pseudobalistes naufragium) and finescale triggerfish (Balistes polylepis)–drove a diurnal trophic cascade extending to algae, and they preferred large pencil urchins (Eucidaris galapagensis) over green urchins (Lytechinus semituberculatus). Triggerfish predation effects were strong, causing a 24-fold reduction of pencil urchin densities during the initial 21 hours of a trophic cascade experiment. A trophic cascade was demonstrated for pencil urchins, but not for green urchins, by significantly higher percent cover of urchin-grazed algae in cages that excluded predatory fish than in predator access (fence) treatments. Pencil urchins were more abundant at night when triggerfish were absent, suggesting that this species persists by exploiting a nocturnal predation refuge. Time-series of pencil urchin survivorship further demonstrated per capita interference effects of hogfish and top predators. These interference effects respectively weakened and extended the trophic cascade to a fourth trophic level through behavioral modifications of the triggerfish-urchin interaction. We conclude that interference behaviors capable of modifying interaction strength warrant greater attention as mechanisms for altering top-down control, particularly in speciose food webs.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>There is increasing awareness that human activities are altering the ways that natural systems operate and that local shifts in species composition and abundance can lead to abrupt and irreversible global change. Therefore, understanding the processes that buffer biological communities from critical shifts and how our actions affect natural stabilizing feedbacks are important goals of ecology. One human activity with far reaching consequences for global ecosystems is the introduction of exotic species outside of their native ranges. Introduced predators, whose effects may be exacerbated by lack of shared evolutionary history with native prey, can have particularly strong effects on recipient communities. As trophic interactions play a central role in both population regulation and community persistence, it is essential to determine the extent to which introduction of novel predators can alter the function of stabilizing mechanisms.</p>
<p>The goals of this dissertation were to use a combination of manipulative field experiments and theoretical modeling to explore how introduced predators influence invaded communities through their effects on the processes that naturally maintain bounded prey population dynamics and promote community coexistence. Density- dependent predation can regulate prey populations by providing a negative feedback in response to changes in population size. In my first experiment (Chapter 2), I investigated the effects of invasive Indo-Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) on density-dependent mortality patterns previously documented to regulate a common native Atlantic prey species, the fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) on coral reefs in the Bahamas. By repeating a pre-invasion density-manipulation experiment, now in the context of predation by both native piscivores and lionfish, I demonstrated that per capita loss of fairy basslet remained density-dependent in the presence of lionfish, but the overall magnitude of loss was substantially greater compared to pre-invasion rates. Per capita loss was higher in 13 out of 16 basslet populations with an average increase of over 60% in the presence of the invader. The before-and-after design provided no evidence for a change in the intensity of density dependence between experiments, indicating the addition of destabilizing density-independent mortality caused by lionfish.</p>
<p>In my second experiment (Chapter 3), I employed a split-plot, cross-factored experimental design, manipulating both fairy basslet density and lionfish presence/absence such that differences in per capita loss rates were attributable only to predation by the invader. Over four weeks, mortality of fairy basslet was far greater on lionfish reefs compared to reefs with only native predators, displaying 2.4 times higher net loss on recruitment-enhanced fairy basslet populations and a five- fold increase in net loss at unmanipulated prey populations. Per capita loss was density-dependent in both predator treatments, but high mortality rates at low prey density on lionfish reefs resulted in extirpation of 15% of unmanipulated fairy basslet populations. In contrast, no prey populations were extirpated on reefs with only native predators.</p>
<p>In addition to field experiments, this dissertation includes a theoretical model (Chapter 4) that explored the effects of predator novelty on the coexistence of an intraguild predation web with adaptive antipredator defense in the shared prey. Adaptive prey responses can promote multi-predator coexistence by creating a stabilizing tradeoff in the allocation of predator-specific defense effort. Yet to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have accurate perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses, assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator. The model showed that the parameter region of IGP coexistence is dramatically reduced by an exotic predator but that effects of novelty on community persistence are complex and context-dependent. Specifically, the model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would persist in the absence of novelty. Coexistence is predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense compared to naïveté and differentially leads to exclusion of native predators in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low. Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. The results suggest that models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has significant implications for food web dynamics.</p>
<p>Overall, the research described in this dissertation illuminates the mechanisms by which introduced predators can disrupt the boundedness and persistence of otherwise stable systems and provides insight into how predator novelty can alter biological communities via novel trophic and non-trophic interactions. As natural systems across the globe face multiple stressors that can alter their functioning, it is increasingly vital to understand the stabilizing mechanisms that buffer these systems from change, and how species introductions may modify the capacity for communities to respond to natural and human-caused disturbance.</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        Kelp forests (Order Laminariales) form key biogenic habitats in coastal regions of temperate and Arctic seas worldwide, providing ecosystem services valued in the range of billions of dollars annually. Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = −0.018 y−1). Our analysis identified declines in 38% of ecoregions for which there are data (−0.015 to −0.18 y−1), increases in 27% of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y−1), and no detectable change in 35% of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.

      <div class="article-style">
        Many populations consist of individuals that differ substantially in their diets. Quantification of the magnitude and temporal consistency of such intraspecific diet variation is needed to understand its importance, but the extent to which different approaches for doing so reflect instantaneous vs. time-aggregated measures of individual diets may bias inferences. We used direct observations of sea otter individuals (<em>Enhydra lutris nereis</em>) to assess how: (1) the timescale of sampling, (2) under-sampling, and (3) the incidence- vs. frequency-based consideration of prey species affect the inferred strength and consistency of intraspecific diet variation. Analyses of feeding observations aggregated over hourly to annual intervals revealed a substantial bias associated with time aggregation that decreases the inferred magnitude of specialization and increases the inferred consistency of individuals’ diets. Time aggregation also made estimates of specialization more sensitive to the consideration of prey frequency, which decreased estimates relative to the use of prey incidence; time aggregation did not affect the extent to which under-sampling contributed to its overestimation. Our analyses demonstrate the importance of studying intraspecific diet variation with an explicit consideration of time and thereby suggest guidelines for future empirical efforts. Failure to consider time will likely produce inconsistent predictions regarding the effects of intraspecific variation on predator–prey interactions.

      <div class="article-style">
        Ecological network models and analyses are recognized as valuable tools for understanding the dynamics and resiliency of ecosystems, and for informing ecosystem-based approaches to management. However, few databases exist that can provide the life history, demographic and species interaction information necessary to parameterize ecological network models. Faced with the difficulty of synthesizing the information required to construct models for kelp forest ecosystems along the West Coast of North America, we developed an online database (<a href="http://kelpforest.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://kelpforest.ucsc.edu/</a>) to facilitate the collation and dissemination of such information. Many of the database&rsquo;s attributes are novel yet the structure is applicable and adaptable to other ecosystem modeling efforts. Information for each taxonomic unit includes stage-specific life history, demography, and body-size allometries. Species interactions include trophic, competitive, facilitative, and parasitic forms. Each data entry is temporally and spatially explicit. The online data entry interface allows researchers anywhere to contribute and access information. Quality control is facilitated by attributing each entry to unique contributor identities and source citations. The database has proven useful as an archive of species and ecosystem-specific information in the development of several ecological network models, for informing management actions, and for education purposes (e.g., undergraduate and graduate training). To facilitate adaptation of the database by other researches for other ecosystems, the code and technical details on how to customize this database and apply it to other ecosystems are freely available and located at the following link (<a href="https://github.com/kelpforest-cameo/databaseui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/kelpforest-cameo/databaseui</a>).

      <div class="article-style">
        San Nicolas Island is surrounded by broad areas of shallow subtidal habitat, characterized by dynamic kelp forest communities that undergo dramatic and abrupt shifts in community composition. Although these reefs are fished, the physical isolation of the island means that they receive less impact from human activities than most reefs in Southern California, making San Nicolas an ideal place to evaluate alternative theories about the dynamics of these communities. Here we present monitoring data from seven sampling stations surrounding the island, including data on fish, invertebrate, and algal abundance. These data are unusual among subtidal monitoring data sets in that they combine relatively frequent sampling (twice per year) with an exceptionally long time series (since 1980). Other outstanding qualities of the data set are the high taxonomic resolution captured and the monitoring of permanent quadrats and swaths where the history of the community structure at specific locations has been recorded through time. Finally, the data span a period that includes two of the strongest ENSO events on record, a major shift in the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the reintroduction of sea otters to the island in 1987 after at least 150 years of absence. These events provide opportunities to evaluate the effects of bottom‐up forcing, top‐down control, and physical disturbance on shallow rocky reef communities.

      <div class="article-style">
        Studies of consumer‐resource interactions suggest that individual diet specialisation is empirically widespread and theoretically important to the organisation and dynamics of populations and communities. We used weighted networks to analyze the resource use by sea otters, testing three alternative models for how individual diet specialisation may arise. As expected, individual specialisation was absent when otter density was low, but increased at high‐otter density. A high‐density emergence of nested resource‐use networks was consistent with the model assuming individuals share preference ranks. However, a density‐dependent emergence of a non‐nested modular network for ‘core’ resources was more consistent with the ‘competitive refuge’ model. Individuals from different diet modules showed predictable variation in rank‐order prey preferences and handling times of core resources, further supporting the competitive refuge model. Our findings support a hierarchical organisation of diet specialisation and suggest individual use of core and marginal resources may be driven by different selective pressures.

      <div class="article-style">
        The patterns of diel activity of four large decapod species in the shallow subtidal of the Isles of Shoals, Gulf of Maine, U.S.A. were investigated. During the summer of 1999 the diel abundance and size distribution of active decapod individuals were surveyed at three depth ranges at a sheltered site on Appledore Island. Densities of active American lobsters, <em>Homarus americanus</em> H. Milne Edwards, 1837, were, as expected, highest at night. The crabs <em>Cancer borealis</em> Stimpson, 1859 and <em>Carcinus maenas</em> (L., 1758), however, were almost exclusively active during the day. <em>Cancer irroratus</em> Say, 1817 were equally active during the day and the night, but the mean size of individuals was significantly larger during the day. Surveys at additional sites in 2003 confirmed that these same patterns of diel activity were present throughout the Isles of Shoals. An extensive review of the literature suggests that such diurnal activity is not only unusual for the three crab species of this study, but for the whole genus Cancer as well.

      <div class="article-style">
        On the rocky shores of the Gulf of Maine, the American lobster, Homarus americanus, the Jonah crab, Cancer borealis, the Rock crab, Cancer irroratus, and the Green crab, Carcinus maenas, compose a guild of highly mobile predators. Although the species are potential competitors that consume the same prey and utilize the same shelters, lobsters also prey on crabs (i.e., lobsters are intraguild predators of crabs). During daytime low tides, crabs are also preyed upon by Larus spp. gulls. In this study, I investigated the importance of avian and intraguild predation in influencing the diel and spatial (depth) patterns of decapod activity in the algal-covered lower intertidal and subtidal zones of Appledore Island, Maine, USA. During the summer months of 1999, the diel abundance and size distribution of active individuals was measured at several depths for each decapod species. Densities of active lobsters were highest at night and did not vary with depth. Contrary to prevailing knowledge, C. borealis and C. maenas were active almost exclusively during the day. While diurnal C. borealis were significantly more abundant in the deepest zone (9-11 m), C. maenas was not found at this depth and was most abundant in the shallowest zone (0-1 m). Day and night C. irroratus densities were not significantly different and showed no significant variation with depth. Only C. irroratus populations exhibited a diel difference in the mean size of individual crabs. The mean size of individuals observed during the day was larger than those observed at night. During the day, C. borealis were larger at depths of 9-11 m than at depths of 1-3 m, while C. maenas crabs were larger at depths of 5-7 m than at depths of 0-1 m.
The magnitude of avian predation was assessed by censuses of crab remains collected in the intertidal during periods of low tide. Results reinforce previous studies in suggesting that gulls are a major factor limiting the upper distribution of C. borealis. In the subtidal, the relative availability of potential shelters does not appear to account for the depth distributions observed among the species. The presence of a potentially sheltering Codium algal canopy at 1 to 7 m may be important for C. maenas and C. irroratus. A subtidal tethering experiment with C. borealis and C. irroratus revealed no diel or depth differences in crab survival. Overall, rates of predation were very low, but were significantly higher for small than for large crabs. Besides lobsters, no other predators were observed at the study site; predation on tethered crabs was therefore attributed to lobsters. In laboratory experiments exposing pairs of small and large C. borealis and C. irroratus to lobsters, small crabs were shown to be significantly more vulnerable to predation than large conspecifics; C. borealis and C. irroratus of similar size were equally vulnerable. Large crabs, however, were attacked 71 times more often than were small crabs. The results of this study reinforce concerns that traditional models of rocky shore community organization must be amended to include mobile predators. They indicate that competitive interactions between small crabs and lobsters may be unimportant relative to intraguild predation. For large crabs, perceived nocturnal intraguild predation pressures may be just as important as competitive interactions between guild members, especially in the recent absence of predatory fishes. These results underline the importance of understanding the ecological history of the community. They suggest that the overfishing of coastal fish populations has increased the relative importance of intraguild interactions and has thereby indirectly strengthened the link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
