      <div class="article-style">
        Understanding coexistence within community modules such as intraguild predation (IGP), where an omnivore both preys on and competes with an intermediate consumer for a shared resource, has provided insight into the mechanisms that promote persistence of complex food webs. Adaptive, predator-specific defense has been shown theoretically to enhance coexistence of IGP communities when employed by shared prey. Yet to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have accurate perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses, assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator. We therefore consider the effects of an introduced predator on IGP coexistence, describing two invasion scenarios: suboptimal defense, whereby a similar invader elicits an ineffective antipredator response; and naïveté toward an unfamiliar invader, for which prey fail to accurately estimate predation risk. We examine predictions for native predator persistence across gradients of enrichment and defense costs using invasibility analysis methods. The model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would persist in the absence of novelty. Coexistence is predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense compared to naïveté and differentially leads to exclusion of native predators in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low. Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. Our results suggest that models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has significant implications for food web dynamics.

Kelp forests are emblematic of such abruptly shifting ecosystems, transitioning from kelp-dominated to urchin-dominated states around the world with increasing frequency, yet the underlying processes and mechanisms that control their dynamics remain unclear. Here, we analyze four decades of data from biannual monitoring around San Nicolas Island, CA, USA, to show that substrate complexity controls both the number of possible (alternative) states and the velocity with which shifts between states occur. The superposition of community dynamics with reconstructions of system stability landscapes reveals that shifts between alternative states at low-complexity sites reflect abrupt, high-velocity events initiated by pulse perturbations that rapidly propel species across dynamically unstable state-space. In contrast, high-complexity sites exhibit a single state of resilient kelp-urchin coexistence.  Our analyses suggest that substrate complexity influences both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes in kelp forests, highlight its influence on kelp-forest stability at both large (island-wide) and small (&lt;10 meter) spatial scales, and could be valuable for holistic kelp-forest management.

      <div class="article-style">
        While the use of networks to understand how complex systems respond to perturbations is pervasive across scientific disciplines, the uncertainty associated with estimates of pairwise interaction strengths (edge weights) remains rarely considered. Mischaracterizations of interaction strength can lead to qualitatively incorrect predictions regarding system responses as perturbations propagate through often counteracting direct and indirect effects.
Here, we introduce PressPurt, a computational package for identifying the interactions whose strengths must be estimated most accurately in order to produce robust predictions of a network&rsquo;s response to press perturbations. The package provides methods for calculating and visualizing these edge-specific sensitivities (tolerances) when uncertainty is associated to one or more edges according to a variety of different error distributions. The software requires the network to be represented as a numerical (quantitative or qualitative) Jacobian matrix evaluated at stable equilibrium.

      <div class="article-style">
        How the direct and indirect effects of species interactions cascade to affect community struc- ture, functioning, and stability is a fundamental question in ecology. In temperate kelp forests, species interactions, in conjunction with environmental processes, produce rich spatiotemporal dy- namics. Arguably the most dramatic of these are abrupt shifts in community state, where forested locations are grazed by herbivorous urchins to establish what is known as an “urchin barren”. The increasing frequency and intensity of perturbation events associated with climate change have in- creased the frequency of shifts towards the barren-state. Understanding not only the mechanisms precipitating state shifts but also those that stabilize both the forested and barren states is essential to guide effective kelp-forest conservation and management strategies. Central to urchin barren establishment is a switch in behavior, where urchins leave cracks and crevices to move across the seafloor and graze upon kelp. While it is known that urchin predators can control urchin density and behavior, it is less clear how resource availability affects urchin behavior, or how the switch in behavior affects kelp-forest dynamics at large. This dissertation evaluated urchin behavior, the “bottom-up” processes controlling it, and the subsequent effects upon kelp-forest dynamics and stability from three distinct directions.
In Chapter 2, I analyzed 38 years of kelp-forest community data and found distinct spatiotem- poral patterns: certain sites exhibited abrupt shifts in state, others exhibited resilient kelp-forest persistence. I suggest that substrate complexity (the rugosity of the benthic substrate) modified both “top-down” and “bottom-up” processes regulating urchin density and behavior. In particular, I suggest that substrate complexity altered the retention of drift algae (also known as kelp detritus, and henceforth, drift)—the senescent form of kelp that has detached from the seafloor. Urchins are believed to prefer drift, such that when drift is abundant urchin remain inactive, consume the drift, and do not graze live kelp. Variation in the retention of drift may thus in-part be responsible for the urchin behavioral switch that leads to the establishment and stabilization of the barren state.
In Chapter 3, I used a one-consumer (urchins) two-resource (kelp and drift) model to test if and how a switch in urchin grazing can precipitate kelp-forest dynamics such as alternative stable states and the emergence of kelp population cycles. Under the assumption that urchins prefer drift over live kelp, results demonstrated that all shifts in state are associated with urchins switching between resources.
In Chapter 4, I experimentally tested the core assumption from Chapter 3, i.e., that urchins “prefer” drift. Specifically, I used a subtidal caging experiment to evaluate the density-dependent effects of drift and kelp upon urchin consumption rates. Results demonstrated a strong preference in urchins to consume drift, that kelp consumption is controlled by the availability of drift (not by kelp itself), and that urchins exhibit a rank switch—a switch in the proportion of resources consumed as total biomass increases—from kelp to drift.
Altogether, this dissertation used long-term monitoring, dynamical modeling, and subtidal experimentation to evaluate the influence of grazer-resource behavior, interactions, and feedbacks upon kelp-forest dynamics and stability. While urchin predators are predominantly thought to control the switch in urchin behavior, I demonstrate how resource availability can also control this behavioral switch. This may help explain shifts to the urchin barren state at locations where urchin predator abundances remain unchanged. Furthermore, my inferences involving substrate complexity and drift as a preferred urchin resource point towards potential strategies with which to conserve or restore kelp-forest ecosystems.

      <div class="article-style">
        Collective behaviour is common in bacteria, plants, and animals, and thus across ecosystems, from biofilms to cities. With collective behaviour, social interactions among individuals propagate to affect the behaviour of groups, while group-level responses in turn affect individual behaviour. These cross-scale feedbacks between individuals, populations and their environments can provide fitness benefits, such as efficient exploitation of uncertain resources as well as costs, such as increased resource competition. While the social mechanics of collective behaviour are increasingly well-studied, its ecological significance remains poorly understood. Here we introduce collective movement into a model of consumer-resource dynamics to demonstrate that collective behaviour can attenuate consumer-resource cycles and promote species coexistence. We focus on collective movement as a particularly well-understood example of collective behaviour. Adding collective movement to canonical unstable ecological scenarios causes emergent social-ecological feedback which mitigates conditions that would otherwise result in extinction. Collective behaviour could play a key role in the maintenance of biodiversity.

      <div class="article-style">
        Functional responses relate a consumer&rsquo;s feeding rates to variation in its abiotic and biotic environment, providing insight into consumer behaviour and fitness, and underpinning population and food‐web dynamics. Despite their broad relevance and long‐standing history, we show here that the types of density dependence found in classic resource‐ and consumer‐dependent functional‐response models equate to strong and often untenable assumptions about the independence of processes underlying feeding rates. We first demonstrate mathematically how to quantify non‐independence between feeding and consumer interference and between feeding on multiple resources. We then analyse two large collections of functional‐response data sets to show that non‐independence is pervasive and borne out in previously hidden forms of density dependence. Our results provide a new lens through which to view variation in consumer feeding rates and disentangle the biological underpinnings of species interactions in multi‐species contexts.

        We consider the goal of predicting how complex networks respond to chronic (press) perturbations when characterizations of their network topology and interaction strengths are associated with uncertainty. Our primary result is the derivation of exact formulas for the expected number and probability of qualitatively incorrect predictions about a system&rsquo;s responses under uncertainties drawn form arbitrary distributions of error. Additional indices provide new tools for identifying which links in a network are most qualitatively and quantitatively sensitive to error, and for determining the volume of errors within which predictions will remain qualitatively determinate (i.e. sign insensitive). Together with recent advances in the empirical characterization of uncertainty in networks, these tools bridge a way towards probabilistic predictions of network dynamics.

      <div class="article-style">
        One of the twenty-first century’s greatest environmental challenges is to recover and restore species, habitats and ecosystems. The decision about how to initiate restoration is best-informed by an understanding of the linkages between ecosystem components and, given these linkages, an appreciation of the consequences of choosing to recover one ecosystem component before another. However, it remains difficult to predict how the sequence of species’ recoveries within food webs influences the speed and trajectory of restoration, and what that means for human well-being. Here, we develop theory to consider the ecological and social implications of synchronous versus sequential (species-by-species) recovery in the context of exploited food webs. A dynamical systems model demonstrates that synchronous recovery of predators and prey is almost always more efficient than sequential recovery. Compared with sequential recovery, synchronous recovery can be twice as fast and produce transient fluctuations of much lower amplitude. A predator-first strategy is particularly slow because it counterproductively suppresses prey recovery. An analysis of real-world predator–prey recoveries shows that synchronous and sequential recoveries are similarly common, suggesting that current practices are not ideal. We highlight policy tools that can facilitate swift and steady recovery of ecosystem structure, function and associated services.

      <div class="article-style">
        The community matrix is among ecology&rsquo;s most important mathematical abstractions, formally encapsulating the interconnected network of effects that species have on one another&rsquo;s populations. Despite its importance, the term “community matrix” has been applied to multiple types of matrices that have differing interpretations. This has hindered the application of theory for understanding community structure and perturbation responses. Here, we clarify the correspondence and distinctions among the Interaction matrix, the Alpha matrix, and the Jacobian matrix, terms that are frequently used interchangeably as well as synonymously with the term “community matrix.” We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed. Our synthesis highlights the empirical challenges that remain in using these tools to understand actual communities.

      <div class="article-style">
        All ecosystems are subjected to chronic disturbances, such as harvest, pollution, and climate change. The capacity to forecast how species respond to such press perturbations is limited by our imprecise knowledge of pairwise species interaction strengths and the many direct and indirect pathways along which perturbations can propagate between species. Network complexity (size and connectance) has thereby been seen to limit the predictability of ecological systems. Here we demonstrate a counteracting mechanism in which the influence of indirect effects declines with increasing network complexity when species interactions are governed by universal allometric constraints. With these constraints, network size and connectance interact to produce a skewed distribution of interaction strengths whose skew becomes more pronounced with increasing complexity. Together, the increased prevalence of weak interactions and the increased relative strength and rarity of strong interactions in complex networks limit disturbance propagation and preserve the qualitative predictability of net effects even when pairwise interaction strengths exhibit substantial variation or uncertainty.

      <div class="article-style">
        Habitat loss, overexploitation, and numerous other stressors have caused global declines in apex predators. This “trophic downgrading” has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat declines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposed stricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three challenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophic interactions, such as resource limitation and competition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of a dynamic ecosystem requires an appreciation of the timing of recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>There is increasing awareness that human activities are altering the ways that natural systems operate and that local shifts in species composition and abundance can lead to abrupt and irreversible global change. Therefore, understanding the processes that buffer biological communities from critical shifts and how our actions affect natural stabilizing feedbacks are important goals of ecology. One human activity with far reaching consequences for global ecosystems is the introduction of exotic species outside of their native ranges. Introduced predators, whose effects may be exacerbated by lack of shared evolutionary history with native prey, can have particularly strong effects on recipient communities. As trophic interactions play a central role in both population regulation and community persistence, it is essential to determine the extent to which introduction of novel predators can alter the function of stabilizing mechanisms.</p>
<p>The goals of this dissertation were to use a combination of manipulative field experiments and theoretical modeling to explore how introduced predators influence invaded communities through their effects on the processes that naturally maintain bounded prey population dynamics and promote community coexistence. Density- dependent predation can regulate prey populations by providing a negative feedback in response to changes in population size. In my first experiment (Chapter 2), I investigated the effects of invasive Indo-Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) on density-dependent mortality patterns previously documented to regulate a common native Atlantic prey species, the fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) on coral reefs in the Bahamas. By repeating a pre-invasion density-manipulation experiment, now in the context of predation by both native piscivores and lionfish, I demonstrated that per capita loss of fairy basslet remained density-dependent in the presence of lionfish, but the overall magnitude of loss was substantially greater compared to pre-invasion rates. Per capita loss was higher in 13 out of 16 basslet populations with an average increase of over 60% in the presence of the invader. The before-and-after design provided no evidence for a change in the intensity of density dependence between experiments, indicating the addition of destabilizing density-independent mortality caused by lionfish.</p>
<p>In my second experiment (Chapter 3), I employed a split-plot, cross-factored experimental design, manipulating both fairy basslet density and lionfish presence/absence such that differences in per capita loss rates were attributable only to predation by the invader. Over four weeks, mortality of fairy basslet was far greater on lionfish reefs compared to reefs with only native predators, displaying 2.4 times higher net loss on recruitment-enhanced fairy basslet populations and a five- fold increase in net loss at unmanipulated prey populations. Per capita loss was density-dependent in both predator treatments, but high mortality rates at low prey density on lionfish reefs resulted in extirpation of 15% of unmanipulated fairy basslet populations. In contrast, no prey populations were extirpated on reefs with only native predators.</p>
<p>In addition to field experiments, this dissertation includes a theoretical model (Chapter 4) that explored the effects of predator novelty on the coexistence of an intraguild predation web with adaptive antipredator defense in the shared prey. Adaptive prey responses can promote multi-predator coexistence by creating a stabilizing tradeoff in the allocation of predator-specific defense effort. Yet to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have accurate perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses, assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator. The model showed that the parameter region of IGP coexistence is dramatically reduced by an exotic predator but that effects of novelty on community persistence are complex and context-dependent. Specifically, the model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would persist in the absence of novelty. Coexistence is predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense compared to naïveté and differentially leads to exclusion of native predators in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low. Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. The results suggest that models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has significant implications for food web dynamics.</p>
<p>Overall, the research described in this dissertation illuminates the mechanisms by which introduced predators can disrupt the boundedness and persistence of otherwise stable systems and provides insight into how predator novelty can alter biological communities via novel trophic and non-trophic interactions. As natural systems across the globe face multiple stressors that can alter their functioning, it is increasingly vital to understand the stabilizing mechanisms that buffer these systems from change, and how species introductions may modify the capacity for communities to respond to natural and human-caused disturbance.</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        Much of the focus in evolutionary biology has been on the adaptive differentiation among organisms. It is equally important to understand the processes that result in similarities of structure among systems. Here, we discuss examples of similarities occurring at different ecological scales, from predator–prey relations (attack rates and handling times) through communities (food-web structures) to ecosystem properties. Selection among systemic configurations or patterns that differ in their intrinsic stability should lead generally to increased representation of relatively stable structures. Such nonadaptive, but selective processes that shape ecological communities offer an enticing mechanism for generating widely observed similarities, and have sparked new interest in stability properties. This nonadaptive systemic selection operates not in opposition to, but in parallel with, adaptive evolution.

      <div class="article-style">
        Knowing how time is distributed within a fossil record is fundamental to paleobiology. Many efforts to quantify temporal resolution have estimated rates of specimen decay from the frequency distribution of specimen ages in near-surface assemblages. The implicit assumption has been that the shape of these distributions is invariant with depth and thus decay-rate estimates reflect the temporal resolution of a fossil record’s deeper layers as well. Here we present a new model that predicts how age-frequency distribution shape will change with depth due to the interplay of burial, mixing, and decay. Unlike previous models, this model distinguishes the dimensions of time, specimen age, and depth, and predicts a right-to-left shift in age-frequency distribution skewness, and a decrease in kurtosis, with increasing stratigraphic depth. We find support for these predictions with the accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dating of 80 small mammal specimens spanning the Quaternary fossil record of Homestead Cave, Utah (United States). Our study indicates (1) that previous models overestimate rates of specimen decay, (2) that the acuity of ecological information captured in near-surface assemblages is higher than previously inferred, and (3) how time-averaging can alter the apparent dynamics of biodiversity over time. We thereby offer a new quantitative framework to account for time-averaging, to merge modern and paleontological archives, and to place ecological systems within the context of their past dynamics.

      <div class="article-style">
        Patterns of species interactions affect the dynamics of food webs. An important component of species interactions that is rarely considered with respect to food webs is the strengths of interactions, which may affect both structure and dynamics. In natural systems, these strengths are variable, and can be quantified as probability distributions. We examined how variation in strengths of interactions can be described hierarchically, and how this variation impacts the structure of species interactions in predator–prey networks, both of which are important components of ecological food webs. The stable isotope ratios of predator and prey species may be particularly useful for quantifying this variability, and we show how these data can be used to build probabilistic predator–prey networks. Moreover, the distribution of variation in strengths among interactions can be estimated from a limited number of observations. This distribution informs network structure, especially the key role of dietary specialization, which may be useful for predicting structural properties in systems that are difficult to observe. Finally, using three mammalian predator–prey networks (two African and one Canadian) quantified from stable isotope data, we show that exclusion of link-strength variability results in biased estimates of nestedness and modularity within food webs, whereas the inclusion of body size constraints only marginally increases the predictive accuracy of the isotope-based network. We find that modularity is the consequence of strong link-strengths in both African systems, while nestedness is not significantly present in any of the three predator–prey networks.

        Over the past 7 years, several authors have used the approach of generalized modeling to study the dynamics of food chains and food webs. Generalized models come close to the efficiency of random matrix models, while being as directly interpretable as conventional differential-equation-based models. Here, we present a pedagogical introduction to the approach of generalized modeling. This introduction places more emphasis on the underlying concepts of generalized modeling than previous publications. Moreover, we propose a shortcut that can significantly accelerate the formulation of generalized models and introduce an iterative procedure that can be used to refine existing generalized models by integrating new biological insights.

      <div class="article-style">
        How best to predict the effects of perturbations to ecological communities has been a long‐standing goal for both applied and basic ecology. This quest has recently been revived by new empirical data, new analysis methods, and increased computing speed, with the promise that ecologically important insights may be obtainable from a limited knowledge of community interactions. We use empirically based and simulated networks of varying size and connectance to assess two limitations to predicting perturbation responses in multispecies communities: (1) the inaccuracy by which species interaction strengths are empirically quantified and (2) the indeterminacy of species responses due to indirect effects associated with network size and structure. We find that even modest levels of species richness and connectance (∼25 pairwise interactions) impose high requirements for interaction strength estimates because system indeterminacy rapidly overwhelms predictive insights. Nevertheless, even poorly estimated interaction strengths provide greater average predictive certainty than an approach that uses only the sign of each interaction. Our simulations provide guidance in dealing with the trade‐offs involved in maximizing the utility of network approaches for predicting dynamics in multispecies communities.

      <div class="article-style">
        A key assumption of the ideal free distribution (IFD) is that there are no costs in moving between habitat patches. However, because many populations  exhibit more or less continuous population movement between patches and traveling  cost is a frequent factor, it is important to determine the effects of costs on  expected population movement patterns and spatial distributions. We consider a food  chain (tritrophic or bitrophic) in which one species moves between patches, with  energy cost or mortality risk in movement. In the two-patch case, assuming forced  movement in one direction, an evolutionarily stable strategy requires bidirectional movement, even if costs during movement are high. In the N-patch case, assuming  that at least one patch is linked bidirectionally to all other patches, optimal  movement rates can lead to source-sink dynamics where patches with negative growth  rates are maintained by other patches with positive growth rates. As well, dispersal  between patches is not balanced (even in the two-patch case), leading to a deviation  from the IFD. Our results indicate that cost-associated forced movement can have  important consequences for spatial metapopulation dynamics. Relevance to marine reserve design and the study of stream communities subject to drift is discussed.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>Few methods for demonstrating the effects of species interactions rival that of the manipulative experiment (Kareiva and Levin 2002). The now commonly performed removal or addition of predators, competitors, or mutualists to experimentally replicated populations of recipient species has irrefutably shown that species can have important effects on each other&rsquo;s populations, and that the strengths of these effects can vary considerably across environmental contexts and species identities. A large body of research is directed towards understanding this variation to forecast community dynamics and dissect how species interactions regulate community structure (Chesson 2000, McCann 2000, Stachowicz 2001, Duffy 2002). It has frequently been pointed out that progress in this field will require more explicit connections between ecological theory and the realities of nature (Laska and Wootton 1998, Parker et al. 1999, Berlow et al. 2004, Agrawal et al. 2007). This requires that interaction strengths measured experimentally be appropriate to the biology of our study systems and the mathematical abstractions we ascribe to them.</p>
<p>Here we clarify some of the assumptions made in the application of the two most commonly used indices for measuring the strengths of species interactions with manipulative removal/addition experiments: Paine&rsquo;s index and the dynamic index. We explain how the values these indices are intended to measure – the per capita interaction strength between two species – are typically not estimated in common currencies. We then introduce extensions to these indices that alleviate a subset of previously made assumptions and limitations. These include a reformulation of Paine&rsquo;s index appropriate for an open‐recruitment system, and an extension of the dynamic index applicable to interactions of a particular nonlinear form. While we focus our language on predator–prey interactions, our discussions are pertinent to the measurement of species effects in other types of interactions as well (Mitchell and Wass 1996, Freckleton et al. 2009).</p>

      <div class="article-style">
        Efforts to estimate the strength of species interactions in species‐rich, reticulate food webs have been hampered by the multitude of direct and indirect interactions such systems exhibit and have been limited by an assumption that pairwise interactions display linear functional forms. Here we present a new method for directly measuring, on a per capita basis, the nonlinear strength of trophic species interactions within such food webs. This is an observation‐based method, requiring three pieces of information: (1) species abundances, (2) predator and prey‐specific handling times, and (3) data from predator‐specific feeding surveys in which the number of individuals observed feeding on each of the predator&rsquo;s prey species has been tallied. The method offers a straightforward way to assess the completeness of one&rsquo;s sampling effort in accurately estimating interaction strengths through the construction of predator‐specific prey accumulation curves. The method should be applicable to a variety of systems in which empirical estimates of direct interaction strengths have thus far remained elusive.

      <div class="article-style">
        <p>Two elements of food webs add significantly to their complexity:  The presence of trophic omnivores and the nonlinear nature of predator-prey interactions. I introduce a new observational method for estimating the strengths of species interactions that accounts for the indeterminacy of omnivorous indirect effects and the saturating functional responses that predators exhibit. I present an empirical validation of the method’s accuracy by applying it to two populations of the predatory whelk, Haustrum (= Lepsiella) scobina, that is common to the rocky intertidal shores of New Zealand, and comparing these interaction strength estimates with those derived from concurrently performed experimental manipulations of H. scobina’s populations.</p>
<p>I then test two key predictions of intraguild predation theory by investigating how species abundances, food web structure and species interactions strengths change across six omnivorous food webs along a gradient of productivity present around New Zealand’s coastline. I find that the intermediate predator, H. scobina, is the superior competitor for shared prey species, as predicted by theory.  Counter to theory, however, I show that it is the omnivorous whelk, H. haustorium, that is the superior competitor when all prey are considered, and that H. scobina’s abundance increases with increasing productivity. My analyses nevertheless reveal clear and regular cross-gradient shifts in interactions that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, I ask to what degree whelk feeding rates are saturated with respect to prey densities and, by extending and parameterizing the classic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, ask whether empirical interactions are nonlinear enough to affect the stability of whelk-prey dynamics. Results indicate that whelk feeding rates are not strongly saturated and that increasing diet richness has a non-additive effect on a predator’s saturation such that alternative prey have a stabilizing effect on whelk-prey dynamics.  I thereby offer a new mechanism by which generalist predators stabilize the dynamics of their species-rich food webs that does not invoke prey switching.</p>
<p>My dissertation brings empirical data to bear on the importance of omnivory and the nonlinear nature of trophic interactions. Furthering our understanding of these food web features can contribute much to both the conceptual and applied goals of ecology.</p>
