Most prior work has assumed that age-prevalence curves are shaped by infection rates, host immunity and/or infection-induced mortality. Interactions between parasites within a host have largely been overlooked as a source of variation in age-prevalence curves. We used field survey data and models to examine the role of interspecific interactions between parasites in shaping age-prevalence curves. The empirical dataset included quantification of parasite infection prevalence for eight co-occurring trematodes in over 15,000 snail hosts. We characterized age-prevalence curves for each taxon, examined how they changed over space in relation to co-occurring trematodes and tested whether the shape of the curves aligned with expectations for the frequencies of coinfections by two taxa in the same host. The models explored scenarios that included negative interspecific interactions between parasites, variation in the force-of-infection (FOI) and infection-induced mortality that varied with host age, which were mechanisms hypothesized to be important in the empirical dataset. In the empirical dataset, four trematode parasites had monotonic increasing age-prevalence curves and four had unimodal age-prevalence curves. Some of the curves remained consistent in shape in relation to the prevalence of other potentially interacting trematodes, while some shifted from unimodal to monotonic increasing, suggesting release from negative interspecific interactions. The most common taxa with monotonic increasing curves had lower co-infection frequencies than expected, suggesting they were competitively dominant. Taxa with unimodal curves had coinfection frequencies that were closer to those expected by chance. The model showed that negative interspecific interactions between parasites can cause a unimodal age-prevalence curve in the subordinate taxon. Increases in the FOI and/or infection-induced mortality of the dominant taxon cause shifts in the peak prevalence of the subordinate taxon to a younger host age. Infection-induced mortality that increased with host age was the only scenario that caused a unimodal curve in the dominant taxon. Results indicated that negative interspecific interactions between parasites contributed to variation in the shape of age-prevalence curves across parasite taxa and support the growing importance of incorporating interactions between parasites in explaining population-level patterns of host infection over space and time.","tags":["Interaction strength","Streams","Parasites"],"title":"Age-prevalence curves in a multi-species parasite community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Novak","Kyle Coblentz","John DeLong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1733011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733011200,"objectID":"de35935b7f9389de90fb0de1d0f8f0ab","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/novak-2025-ab/","publishdate":"2024-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/novak-2025-ab/","section":"publication","summary":" Ecologists differ in the degree to which they consider the linear Type I functional response to be an unrealistic versus sufficient representation of predator feeding rates. Empiricists tend to consider it unsuitably non-mechanistic and theoreticians tend to consider it necessarily simple. Holling’s original rectilinear model is dismissed by satisfying neither desire, with most compromising on the smoothly saturating Type II response for which searching and handling are assumed to be mutually exclusive activities. We derive a “multiple-prey-at-a-time” functional response and a generalization that includes the Type III to reflect predators that can continue to search when handling an arbitrary number of already-captured prey. The multi-prey model clarifies the empirical relevance of Holling’s linear and rectilinear models and the conditions under which linearity can be a mechanistically-reasoned description of predator feeding rates, even when handling times are long. We find support for the presence of linearity in 35% of 2,591 compiled empirical datasets, and find evidence that larger predator-prey body-mass ratios permit predators to search while handling greater numbers of prey. Incorporating the multi-prey response into the Rosenzweig-MacArthur population-dynamics model reveals that a non-exclusivity of searching and handling can lead to coexistence states and dynamics that are not anticipated by theory built on Holling’s traditional models. In particular, it can lead to bistable fixed-point and limit-cycle dynamics with long-term crawl-by transients between them under conditions where abundance ratios reflect top-heavy food webs and the functional response is linear. We conclude that functional response linearity should not be considered empirically unrealistic but also that that more bounded conclusions should be drawn in theory presuming the Type I to be appropriate.

Trophic interactions strengths, which underpin ecosystem stability and dynamics, are no exception, exhibiting statistical and scaling relationships with predator and prey traits that lack a causal evolutionary explanation. Here we propose two universal rules that explain the scaling of trophic interaction strengths through predator functional responses - the relationship between predator feeding rates and prey densities. First, functional responses must allow predators to meet their energetic demands when prey are rare. Second, functional responses should approach their maxima near the highest prey densities that predators experience. We show that parameterized mathematical equations derived from these two rules predict functional response parameters across over 2,100 functional response experiments. They also provide additional predictions including consistent patterns of feeding rate saturation with prey densities among predators, a slow-fast continuum in functional response parameters, and the allometric scaling of those parameters. The two rules thereby offer an ultimate explanation for the determinants of trophic interaction strengths and their scaling, revealing the importance of ecologically realized constraints to the complex, adaptive nature of functional response evolution.","tags":["Interaction strength","Functional response"],"title":"Simple, universal rules predict trophic interaction strengths","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Novak","Daniel Stouffer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1710288000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710288000,"objectID":"851a775d3ae1cb0681d148873880757f","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/novak-2024-aa/","publishdate":"2024-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/novak-2024-aa/","section":"publication","summary":" Due to an error in our formulation of the citardauq solution to quadratic equations, our reformulation of the Steady State Saturation (SSS) model of Jeschke et al.

Rarely, however, are surveys alone sufficient for providing direct insight into the rates of ecological processes that underlie how communities function, either now or in the past. In this study, I used a statistically-reasoned observational approach to estimate the feeding rates of a New Zealand intertidal predator, *Haustrum haustorium*, using diet surveys performed at several sites by Robert Paine in 1968--9 and by me in 2004. Comparisons between time periods reveal a remarkable consistency in *Haustrum haustorium*'s prey-specific feeding rates, which contrasts with the changes I observed in prey abundances, *Haustrum haustorium*'s body size distribution, and the proportional contributions of *Haustrum haustorium*'s prey to its apparent diet. Although these results imply accompanying and perhaps adaptive changes in\t*Haustrum haustorium*'s prey preferences, they are nonetheless anticipated by *Haustrum haustorium*'s high range of variation in prey-specific handling times that dictate not only its maximum possible feeding rates but also the probabilities with which feeding events may be detected during diet surveys. Similarly high variation in detection times (i.e. handling and digestion times) is evident in predator species throughout the animal kingdom. The potential disconnect between a predator's apparent diet and its actual feeding rates suggests that much of the temporal and biogeographic variation that is perceived in predator diets and food-web structures may be of less functional consequence than currently assumed.

Adaptive, predator-specific defense has been shown theoretically to enhance coexistence of IGP communities when employed by shared prey. Yet to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have accurate perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses, assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator. We therefore consider the effects of an introduced predator on IGP coexistence, describing two invasion scenarios: suboptimal defense, whereby a similar invader elicits an ineffective antipredator response; and naïveté toward an unfamiliar invader, for which prey fail to accurately estimate predation risk. We examine predictions for native predator persistence across gradients of enrichment and defense costs using invasibility analysis methods. The model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would persist in the absence of novelty. Coexistence is predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense compared to naïveté and differentially leads to exclusion of native predators in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low. Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. Our results suggest that models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has significant implications for food web dynamics.

Here, we analyze four decades of data from biannual monitoring around San Nicolas Island, CA, USA, to show that substrate complexity controls both the number of possible (alternative) states and the velocity with which shifts between states occur. The superposition of community dynamics with reconstructions of system stability landscapes reveals that shifts between alternative states at low-complexity sites reflect abrupt, high-velocity events initiated by pulse perturbations that rapidly propel species across dynamically unstable state-space. In contrast, high-complexity sites exhibit a single state of resilient kelp-urchin coexistence.

In temperate kelp forests, species interactions, in conjunction with environmental processes, produce rich spatiotemporal dy- namics. Arguably the most dramatic of these are abrupt shifts in community state, where forested locations are grazed by herbivorous urchins to establish what is known as an “urchin barren”. The increasing frequency and intensity of perturbation events associated with climate change have in- creased the frequency of shifts towards the barren-state. Understanding not only the mechanisms precipitating state shifts but also those that stabilize both the forested and barren states is essential to guide effective kelp-forest conservation and management strategies. Central to urchin barren establishment is a switch in behavior, where urchins leave cracks and crevices to move across the seafloor and graze upon kelp. While it is known that urchin predators can control urchin density and behavior, it is less clear how resource availability affects urchin behavior, or how the switch in behavior affects kelp-forest dynamics at large. This dissertation evaluated urchin behavior, the “bottom-up” processes controlling it, and the subsequent effects upon kelp-forest dynamics and stability from three distinct directions.\nIn Chapter 2, I analyzed 38 years of kelp-forest community data and found distinct spatiotem- poral patterns: certain sites exhibited abrupt shifts in state, others exhibited resilient kelp-forest persistence. I suggest that substrate complexity (the rugosity of the benthic substrate) modified both “top-down” and “bottom-up” processes regulating urchin density and behavior. In particular, I suggest that substrate complexity altered the retention of drift algae (also known as kelp detritus, and henceforth, drift)—the senescent form of kelp that has detached from the seafloor. Urchins are believed to prefer drift, such that when drift is abundant urchin remain inactive, consume the drift, and do not graze live kelp. Variation in the retention of drift may thus in-part be responsible for the urchin behavioral switch that leads to the establishment and stabilization of the barren state.\nIn Chapter 3, I used a one-consumer (urchins) two-resource (kelp and drift) model to test if and how a switch in urchin grazing can precipitate kelp-forest dynamics such as alternative stable states and the emergence of kelp population cycles. Under the assumption that urchins prefer drift over live kelp, results demonstrated that all shifts in state are associated with urchins switching between resources.\nIn Chapter 4, I experimentally tested the core assumption from Chapter 3, i.e., that urchins “prefer” drift. Specifically, I used a subtidal caging experiment to evaluate the density-dependent effects of drift and kelp upon urchin consumption rates. Results demonstrated a strong preference in urchins to consume drift, that kelp consumption is controlled by the availability of drift (not by kelp itself), and that urchins exhibit a rank switch—a switch in the proportion of resources consumed as total biomass increases—from kelp to drift.\nAltogether, this dissertation used long-term monitoring, dynamical modeling, and subtidal experimentation to evaluate the influence of grazer-resource behavior, interactions, and feedbacks upon kelp-forest dynamics and stability. While urchin predators are predominantly thought to control the switch in urchin behavior, I demonstrate how resource availability can also control this behavioral switch. This may help explain shifts to the urchin barren state at locations where urchin predator abundances remain unchanged. Furthermore, my inferences involving substrate complexity and drift as a preferred urchin resource point towards potential strategies with which to conserve or restore kelp-forest ecosystems.

Such information criteria allow comparison across diverse models because they penalize each model’s fit by its parametric complexity — in terms of their number of free parameters — which allows simpler models to outperform similarly fitting models of higher parametric complexity. However, criteria like AIC and BIC do not consider an additional form of model complexity, referred to as geometric complexity, which relates specifically to the mathematical form of the model. Models of equivalent parametric complexity can differ in their geometric complexity and thereby in their ability to flexibly fit data. Here we use the Fisher Information Approximation criterion to compare, explain, and contextualize how geometric complexity varies across a large compilation of single-prey functional-response models — including prey-, ratio-, and predator-dependent formulations — reflecting varying levels of phenomenological generality and varying apparent degrees and forms of non-linearity. Because a model’s geometric complexity varies with the data’s underlying experimental design, we also sought to determine which designs are best at leveling the playing field among functional-response models. Our analyses illustrate (1) the large differences in geometric complexity that exist among functional-response models, (2) there is no experimental design that can minimize these differences across all models, and (3) even the qualitative nature by which some models are more or less flexible than others is reversed by changes in experimental design. Failure to appreciate geometric complexity in the empirical evaluation of functional-response models may therefore lead to biased inferences for predator-prey ecology, particularly at low experimental sample sizes where the relative effects of geometric complexity are strongest. We conclude by discussing the statistical and epistemological challenges that geometric complexity poses for the study of functional responses as it relates to the attainment of biological truth and predictive ability.

Empirical insights have also been constrained by an assumption that the feeding behaviors of specialist predators are representative of the behaviors exhibited by generalist predators, which are far more common in nature. This is largely because logistical and statistical constraints have limited almost all studies to species-poor systems of single predator species interacting with only one primary prey species.

We then analyse two large collections of functional‐response data sets to show that non‐independence is pervasive and borne out in previously hidden forms of density dependence.

We also used empirically parameterized simulations to examine the effects of handling-time variation among individuals on population-level feeding rates.\nWithin cages, individual attack-rate variation reduced population-level whelk feeding rates. However, the magnitude of this reduction differed among prey species and cages depending on cage-specific magnitudes of attack-rate variation and functional-response nonlinearity. The inferred effects of handling-time variation among individuals were of smaller magnitude than those of attack-rate variation, yet counteracted them to cause a net weakening of the effect of individual attack-rate variation on population-level feeding rates. Across cages, attack-rate and prey-density variation had non-additive effects that produced greater feeding-rate reductions at the experiment scale relative to the cage scale.\nOur results indicate that the effects of trait variation via nonlinear averaging depend critically on the features of systems that determine the magnitudes of nonlinearities and trait variation.

We then compared the rates of biomass flow from snails Juga plicifera into trematode parasites relative to aquatic vertebrate predators (sculpin, cutthroat trout and Pacific giant salamanders). The trematode parasite community had the fifth highest dry biomass density among stream organisms (0.40 g/m2) and exceeded the combined biomass of aquatic insects. Only host snails (3.88 g/m2), sculpin (1.11 g/m2), trout (0.73 g/m2) and crayfish (0.43 g/m2) had a greater biomass. The parasite ?extended phenotype?, consisting of trematode plus castrated host biomass, exceeded the individual biomass of every taxonomic group other than snails. The substantial parasite biomass stemmed from the high snail density and infection prevalence, and the large proportional mass of infected hosts that consisted of trematode tissue (M = 31% per snail). Estimates of yearly biomass transfer from snails into trematodes were slightly higher than the combined estimate of snail biomass transfer into the three vertebrate predators. Pacific giant salamanders accounted for 90% of the snail biomass consumed by predators.

Intra- and interspecific diet variation changed substantially across seasons, with much greater interspecific variation in spring than in summer and autumn. Interspecific differences in foraging mode (e.g., benthic vs drift feeding) were associated with predator-specific responses to a seasonal pulse in the availability of terrestrial thrip larvae (Thysanoptera) and contributed to temporal variation in trophic niche differentiation. These findings show that the relative magnitudes of intra- and interspecific diet differentiation can change over time in systems that receive seasonal resource pulses.

Individual diet variation, defined as individual variation in food resource use within a population that is consistent over time, is gaining recognition as an important factor influencing larger-scale processes. Spatial and temporal predictability of prey resources, individual movement behaviors, and diet choice may all serve to maintain individual diet specialization. However, the relationships between these factors in establishing and maintaining individual-level variation at ecological scales remains poorly understood. This dissertation provides insight into the dependence of individual diet specialization on the predictability, productivity, and spatial structure of prey by integrating feedbacks between individual behaviors, populations, and communities at local and regional scales.\n\nForaging theory seeks to understand the relationships between the energetic demands of a predator, prey selection, patchiness of prey, and individual movement. To maximize energetic intake, a foraging predator must balance energy expended by foraging movements with energy gained via prey consumption, with foraging success greatly impacted by the scale of patchiness of prey. In Chapter 2, I correlated scale- dependent prey patchiness and predator feeding rates to predict predator movement in a heterogeneous prey environment. I then compared these predictions to observed movement of a predatory intertidal whelk Nucella ostrina over a 3-month period. I found that combining prey patchiness and predator feeding rates sufficiently explains predator movement rates, highlighting a tradeoff between prey heterogeneity and individual energetic demands in determining predator foraging behavior.\n\nForaging behavior can maintain variation in individual diet, with differential habitat use and prey selection correlated with different foraging strategies. Optimal search strategies for a foraging predator depend on the abundance and predictability of prey, therefore differences in individual diet breadth are thought to produce different foraging patterns. In Chapter 3, I connected the broad-scale movement patterns found in Chapter 2 with variation in individual foraging behavior by quantifying variation in individual foraging patterns and correlating these patterns to habitat use and diet breadth. I found evidence for variation in individual behaviors, habitat use, and diet diversity. However, there was an overwhelming influence of tidal cycles on movement patterns, rather than associations with prey choice or habitat occupancy. This is likely due to the high degree of prey productivity at my focal study site, making random search patterns and small foraging movements sufficiently efficient for finding prey.\n\nWhile prey heterogeneity and individual behaviors within a population can maintain variation in individual diet at local scales, the processes that establish individual diet variation requires further study. The lack of environmental predictability has been posited to promote inter-individual differences on both ecological and evolutionary timescales, as tradeoffs between being a prey specialist versus a generalist result in one being favored over the other in certain environmental predictability regimes. In Chapter 4, I used manipulative laboratory experiments to investigate the role of site-specific environmental unpredictability on the relative contributions of learning and heritable diet plasticity in shaping the foraging efficiency of whelk hatchlings. My results indicated the importance of learning in individual foraging and prey handling efficiency. Additionally, there is suggestive evidence that prey predictability at the population source location decreases foraging times as well. However, site attributes or behavioral modification may play a larger role than prey predictability in determining individual foraging abilities I detected.

Yet food webs also show emergent properties that appear consistent, such as a skewed frequency distribution of interaction strengths (many weak, few strong). Reconciling these two properties requires an understanding of the variation in pairwise interaction strengths and its underlying mechanisms. We estimated stream sculpin feeding rates in three seasons at nine sites in Oregon to examine variation in trophic interaction strengths both across and within predator–prey pairs. Predator and prey densities, prey body mass, and abiotic factors were considered as putative drivers of within‐pair variation over space and time. We hypothesized that consistently skewed interaction strength distributions could result if individual interaction strengths show relatively little variation, or alternatively, if interaction strengths vary but shift in ways that conserve their overall frequency distribution. Feeding rate distributions remained consistently and positively skewed across all sites and seasons. The mean coefficient of variation in feeding rates within each of 25 focal species pairs across surveys was less than half the mean coefficient of variation seen across species pairs within a survey. The rank order of feeding rates also remained conserved across streams, seasons and individual surveys. On average, feeding rates on each prey taxon nonetheless varied by a hundredfold, with some feeding rates showing more variation in space and others in time. In general, feeding rates increased with prey density and decreased with high stream flows and low water temperatures, although for nearly half of all species pairs, factors other than prey density explained the most variation. Our findings show that although individual interaction strengths exhibit considerable variation in space and time, they can nonetheless remain relatively consistent, and thus predictable, compared to the even larger variation that occurs across species pairs. These results highlight how the ecological scale of inference can strongly shape conclusions about interaction strength consistency and help reconcile how the skewed nature of interaction strength distributions can persist in highly dynamic food webs.

A classic approach to community ecology assumes that individuals within a species are functionally identical and that consumer-resource dynamics can be predicted solely by using species abundances. However, one species can consist of multiple functional groups, as diet differences among life stages of a single species may be greater than the diet differences among species. Because of variation in diets over a lifetime, we must ask: under what circumstances can individuals be simplified into a collective species, and when does it matter to focus on intraspecific variation? I examined the role of stage structure in species interactions and its consequences across levels of biological organization.\n\nIn chapter 2, I conducted a functional response experiment in the laboratory to examine the role of body size, temperature, ontogenetic stage, and larval stonefly density on crayfish feeding rates. I found that the effect of temperature was stage-dependent as juveniles increased feeding with temperature, whereas adult feeding rate was similar across temperature treatments. Adult crayfish reduced their attack rate with increased stonefly density, which is either reflective of their biology or an artifact of experimental\n\ndesign. Nonetheless, size- and temperature- dependent functional response models that included stage structure performed better than models without stage structure, highlighting the importance of incorporating stage structure into measures of species interaction strengths.\n\nIn chapter 3, I used metacommunity theory as a lens to explore how crayfish ontogenetic stage and sex alter the effect of diet on gut microbial communities. There was little overlap in the microbial community between crayfish in the lab and those in the wild, indicating that gut microbes are transient. The similarities in microbial community composition between food items and crayfish suggest that their gut microbes are mainly from their food and not from the surrounding environment. There were stage- and sex- dependent effects on gut microbial communities, likely due to differences in behavior and physiology between the stages and sexes. Though stage, sex, and diet influenced gut microbial communities, they had low explanatory power. Addressing connectivity between hosts or feedbacks between the host and the environment on gut microbial communities are potential avenues for future work. Species introductions can alter the relationship between trophic interactions and ecosystem processes. Often, introduced species reduce the abundance and diversity of biota in recipient food webs. However, ontogenetic diet shifts in the introduced species can alter the presence, degree or direction of these impacts on native species, making it difficult for scientists and managers to predict the ecological consequences of species introductions. In chapter 4, I conducted a manipulative field experiment to assess the effects of crayfish species identity and ontogenetic stage on benthic invertebrate composition and abundance as well as leaf litter breakdown by native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and introduced ringed crayfish (Faxonius neglectus neglectus). Treatments with signal crayfish or adult crayfish had higher reductions in leaf litter relative to treatments with introduced crayfish and juvenile crayfish. Alpha and beta diversity of benthic invertebrates was similar among treatments, but there were fewer shredders in treatments with adult crayfish. Thus, I show that ontogenetic stage and native vs. non-native status both matter for understanding the impact of species introductions on local ecological communities and ecosystem processes.\n\nIn Chapter 5, I presented the challenges of uniting ecological theory and empirical data. I designed an experiment that investigated the roles of consumer body size and ontogenetic stage, environmental temperature, and resource quality on consumer-resource interactions. My goal was to bridge the Metabolic Theory of Ecology and Ecological Stoichiometry to describe how the balance leaf litter nutrient availability and crayfish elemental demand govern their feeding rates and nutrient cycling over ontogeny, but my models did not fit the data well. This developed into a philosophical dilemma: as scientists, do we choose to work in systems that will produce data that we know will fit our model, or do we test a model in various systems to see how generalizable our predictions can be? I explored the culture of science, focusing on the existence of paradigms in ecology that discourage “negative results” and the obstacles one might face in conducting functional response experiments. Specifically, I reviewed experimental design and statistical methods used in functional response literature and how they can be biased to maintain paradigms in ecology.\n\nMy dissertation contributes to our understanding on the role of intraspecific variation in ecology. I examined consumer-resource interactions (Ch. 2), community structure (Ch. 3), and ecosystem processes (Ch. 4 and 5) to assess the effect of stage structure on species interactions and their consequences across multiple scales of organization.

Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems? intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsicredictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE?FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.","tags":["Dynamics","Time-series"],"title":"The intrinsic predictability of ecological time series and its potential to guide forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kyle Coblentz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617376892,"objectID":"a78290927653e91fd9c7fb593820103c","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/coblentz-2018-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T15:21:28.098015Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coblentz-2018-aa/","section":"publication","summary":" Diet variation among individuals within populations is widespread. Often diet dierences among individuals are attributable to obvious differences among individuals such as age, sex, or morphology. However, growing evidence suggests that individual diet variation is also common among seemingly identical individuals within populations. This phenomenon has been termed individual diet specialization. Individual diet specialization has been documented across a variety of taxa and biomes and theory suggests that diet specialization can potentially alter the structure and strength of predator-prey interactions. This raises two important questions: 1) What are the causes of individual diet specialization?, and 2) What are the potential consequences of diet specialization for populations and communities? In this dissertation, I attempt to address these two questions by combining mathematical theory, the novel application of statistical methods, and field and laboratory experiments with the intertidal whelk, Nucella ostrina.\n\nA potential ultimate cause of variation among individuals is disruptive selection in which natural selection favors individuals with more extreme trait values over individuals with intermediate trait values. Theory has suggested that the availability of alternative resources and intraspecific competition for those resources can drive disruptive selection in consumers and lead to increased diet variation. However, this theory makes several ecologically unrealistic assumptions. In particular, this theory assumes that consumers have linear functional responses and that the trait of the consumer under selection only influences the consumer’s attack rates on resources. In Chapter 2, I alleviate these assumptions and show that nonlinear functional responses and traits influencing multiple functional response parameters simultaneously can influence the strength and likelihood of disruptive selection. My results suggest the characteristics of consumers in which disrup- tive selection in resource-use traits may occur and diet specialization through this mechanism may be most likely.\n\nTo empirically evaluate hypotheses on the causes and consequences of individ- ual diet specialization, we need to be able to accurately quantify diet specialization. In Chapter 3, I apply Bayesian hierarchical models to the problem of estimating diet specialization and compare the performance of the Bayesian hierarchical models to currently used methods for estimating diet specialization. Currently used methods infer individual prey preferences using the observed proportion of prey in individuals’ diets whereas the Bayesian hierarchical models instead estimate these proportions. I find that the currently used approach tends to overestimate diet specialization compared to the Bayesian hierarchical approach. This is especially the case when sample sizes per individual are low or heterogeneous. In addition, the Bayesian hierarchical approach provides estimates of prey proportions, their variability, and the uncertainty on these estimates in ways that are inaccessible to current methods. These results suggest that the Bayesian hierarchical method can provide an improved method for quantifying diet specialization.\n\nIn Chapter 4, I present the results from a field caging experiment examining the proximate ecological mechanisms determining individual diet specialization and its consequences in the intertidal whelk, Nucella ostrina. Many of the hypotheses on the ecological causes of diet specialization assume that individuals differ from one another in their prey preferences. However, these hypotheses ignore the potential influence of stochasticity in the foraging process in generating diet variation among individuals. The results of this chapter suggest that changes in the magnitude of diet variation with changes in prey community composition in Nucella ostrina can largely be explained by stochastic foraging by individuals with shared prey pref- erences. In this chapter, I also estimate the consequences of this diet variation for estimates of predator feeding rates through nonlinear averaging (Jensen’s inequality) of predator attack rates. The results suggest that nonlinear averaging alters the perceived strength of predator-prey interactions in this system providing one of the first empirical estimates of the potential consequences of diet variation.\n\nOverall, my dissertation provides several insights into the potential causes of diet specialization, provides one of the first empirical estimates of a possibly widespread consequence of diet specialization for populations and communities, and suggests improved statistical methodology for quantifying diet specialization. I believe that this dissertation will lead to a critical assessment of definitions of individual diet specialization, provide guidance towards systems in which diet specialization is the most likely to occur, and encourage further empirical research estimating the e↵ects of diet specialization on populations and communities.

Multiple factors have been linked to trophic interaction strength variation, including species densities, species traits, and abiotic factors. Yet most empirical tests of the relative roles of multiple mechanisms that drive variation have been limited to simplified experiments that may diverge from the dynamics of natural food webs. Here, we used a field-based observational approach to quantify the roles of prey density, predator density, predator-prey body-mass ratios, prey identity, and abiotic factors in driving variation in feeding rates of reticulate sculpin (Cottus perplexus). We combined data on over 6,000 predator-prey observations with prey identification time functions to estimate 289 prey-specific feeding rates at nine stream sites in Oregon. Feeding rates on 57 prey types showed an approximately log-normal distribution, with few strong and many weak interactions. Model selection indicated that prey density, followed by prey identity, were the two most important predictors of prey-specific sculpin feeding rates. Feeding rates showed a positive relationship with prey taxon densities that was inconsistent with predator saturation predicted by current functional response models. Feeding rates also exhibited four orders-of-magnitude in variation across prey taxonomic orders, with the lowest feeding rates observed on prey with significant anti-predator defenses. Body-mass ratios were the third most important predictor variable, showing a hump-shaped relationship with the highest feeding rates at intermediate ratios. Sculpin density was negatively correlated with feeding rates, consistent with the presence of intraspecific predator interference. Our results highlight how multiple co-occurring drivers shape trophic interactions in nature and underscore ways in which simplified experiments or reliance on scaling laws alone may lead to biased inferences about the structure and dynamics of species-rich food webs.","tags":["Interaction strength","Food webs","Streams","Functional response","Observational approach"],"title":"What drives interaction strengths in complex food webs?

This effort has focused primarily on statistical significance testing and obtaining point estimates of parameters that contribute to interaction strength magnitudes, leaving the characterization of uncertainty associated with those estimates unconsidered. We consider a means of characterizing the uncertainty of a generalist predator’s interaction strengths by formulating an observational method for estimating a predator’s prey-specific per capita attack rates as a Bayesian statistical model. This formulation permits the explicit incorporation of multiple sources of uncertainty. A key insight is the informative nature of several so-called non-informative priors that have been used in modeling the sparse data typical of predator feeding surveys. We introduce to ecology a new neutral prior and provide evidence for its superior performance. We use a case study to consider the attack rates in a New Zealand intertidal whelk predator, and we illustrate not only that Bayesian point estimates can be made to correspond with those obtained by frequentist approaches, but also that estimation uncertainty as described by 95% intervals is more useful and biologically realistic using the Bayesian method. In particular, unlike in bootstrap confidence intervals, the lower bounds of the Bayesian posterior intervals for attack rates do not include zero when a predator–prey interaction is in fact observed. We conclude that the Bayesian framework provides a straightforward, probabilistic characterization of interaction strength uncertainty, enabling future considerations of both the deterministic and stochastic drivers of interaction strength and their impact on food webs.","tags":["Interaction strength","Functional response","Intertidal","Observational approach"],"title":"Bayesian characterization of uncertainty in species interaction strengths","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tamara Layden"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617376892,"objectID":"fd2c6fbe2d08e30a1a69372c52bce4e9","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/layden-2017/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T15:21:28.098015Z","relpermalink":"/publication/layden-2017/","section":"publication","summary":" Parasites are increasingly recognized for their significant roles in shaping community structure and ecosystem dynamics. Due to their cryptic nature, however, they are often neglected in measurements of energy flow and biomass in ecosystems. Past studies have demonstrated that parasites directly contribute to the flow of energy through marine estuaries and freshwater wetlands, yet it remains unknown how broadly applicable these findings are across other ecosystems. The aim of our study was to quantify the role of trematode parasites in the flow of energy through freshwater streams, using biomass as a proxy for energy flow. To accomplish this, we quantified the density and size distributions of aquatic organisms using quadrat and surber samplers within three Oregon steams (n = 9 field sites total) during the summer months. We then used length-to-mass regressions to estimate the free-living biomass of each organism per unit area. To estimate trematode biomass, we dissected freshwater snail hosts, Juga plicifera, quantifying infection prevalence and trematode mass as a function of host body size for each trematode taxon. \n\nJuga snails dominated the standing crop biomass of aquatic invertebrates, constituting an average of 87.5% of the total invertebrate biomass across the three streams (mean = 3.77 g m2). The other most important groups included Coleoptera (0.0315 g m2), Plecoptera (0.0138 g m2), Trichoptera (0.0129 g m2), and Odonata (0.0128 g m2). We identified five trematode taxa that infected Juga snails at our field sites (Metagonimoides oregonensis, Nanophyetus salmincola, Acanthatrium oregonense, Derogenidae spp., and Opecoilidae spp.). Trematode tissue comprised an average of 31% of the total body mass of each infected snail at the individual level, with a positive correlation between snail size and percent trematode mass. Trematode biomass ranged from 4% to 17% of the total population-level snail biomass, averaging 0.392 g m2 across the sites. Trematode biomass exceeded all taxon-specific and total free-living insect biomass (mean = 0.096 g m2). Our results suggest that trematodes are capable of surpassing the roles of many major free-living invertebrates in the movement of energy through these stream food webs. Furthermore, because few aquatic predators consume Juga snails, trematodes potentially alter pathways of energy flow by routing snail production through parasites and into other components of the aquatic food web.

To test this hypothesis, we used an open experimental design in the Galápagos rocky subtidal that enabled a diverse guild of fish species, in the presence of each other and top predators (sea lions and sharks), to attack two species of sea urchins grazing on benthic algae. Time-lapse photography of experiments on natural and experimental substrates revealed strong species identity effects: only two predator species–blunthead triggerfish (Pseudobalistes naufragium) and finescale triggerfish (Balistes polylepis)–drove a diurnal trophic cascade extending to algae, and they preferred large pencil urchins (Eucidaris galapagensis) over green urchins (Lytechinus semituberculatus). Triggerfish predation effects were strong, causing a 24-fold reduction of pencil urchin densities during the initial 21 hours of a trophic cascade experiment. A trophic cascade was demonstrated for pencil urchins, but not for green urchins, by significantly higher percent cover of urchin-grazed algae in cages that excluded predatory fish than in predator access (fence) treatments. Pencil urchins were more abundant at night when triggerfish were absent, suggesting that this species persists by exploiting a nocturnal predation refuge. Time-series of pencil urchin survivorship further demonstrated per capita interference effects of hogfish and top predators. These interference effects respectively weakened and extended the trophic cascade to a fourth trophic level through behavioral modifications of the triggerfish-urchin interaction. We conclude that interference behaviors capable of modifying interaction strength warrant greater attention as mechanisms for altering top-down control, particularly in speciose food webs.","tags":["Interaction strength","Subtidal","Time-series","Higher-order effects","Functional response"],"title":"Experimental demonstration of a trophic cascade in the Galápagos rocky subtidal:  Effects of consumer identity and behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brent Hughes","Rodrigo Beas-Luna","Allie Barner","Kimberly Brewitt","Dan Brumbaugh","Liz Cerny-Chipman","Sarah Close","Kyle Coblentz","Kristin de Nesnera","Sarah Drobnitch","Jared Figurski","Becky Focht","Maya Friedman","Jan Freiwald","Kristen Heady","Walter Heady","Annaliese Hettinger","Angela Johnson","Kendra Karr","Brenna Mahoney","Monica Moritsch","Ann-Marie Osterback","Jessica Reimer","Jonathan Robinson","Tully Rohrer","Jeremy Rose","Megan Sabal","Leah Segui","Chenchen Shen","Jenna Sullivan","Rachel Zuercher","Pete Raimondi","Bruce Menge","Kirsten Grorud-Colvert","Mark Novak","Mark Carr"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371662,"objectID":"8077edf6ad81a0aad7b5651e9f692d77","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/hughes-2017-uq/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:22.21664Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hughes-2017-uq/","section":"publication","summary":" As the contribution for long-term ecological and environmental studies (LTEES) to our understanding of how species and ecosystems respond to a changing global climate becomes more urgent, the relative number and investment in LTEES are declining.

However, it remains difficult to predict how the sequence of species’ recoveries within food webs influences the speed and trajectory of restoration, and what that means for human well-being. Here, we develop theory to consider the ecological and social implications of synchronous versus sequential (species-by-species) recovery in the context of exploited food webs. A dynamical systems model demonstrates that synchronous recovery of predators and prey is almost always more efficient than sequential recovery. Compared with sequential recovery, synchronous recovery can be twice as fast and produce transient fluctuations of much lower amplitude. A predator-first strategy is particularly slow because it counterproductively suppresses prey recovery. An analysis of real-world predator–prey recoveries shows that synchronous and sequential recoveries are similarly common, suggesting that current practices are not ideal.

One common method for quantifying feeding rates in fishes combines mass‐based diet data with gastric evacuation times to estimate prey mass consumed per predator. An alternative approach is to estimate the rates of prey individuals consumed using prey identification time—the time period over which prey remain identifiable in a predator's stomach. One challenge with the analysis of prey identification times, however, is that the response variable is likely to be censored because the “true” prey identification time cannot be observed directly. Here, we applied survival analysis that can incorporate censored data to estimate the effects of predator body size, water temperature, and prey characteristics (type, count, and body size) on identification times in Reticulate Sculpin Cottus perplexus. We focused on seven types of prey that are common in this generalist predator's diet: mayflies (Ephemeroptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), true flies (Diptera), beetles (Coleoptera), worms (Annelida), and sculpin eggs. An information‐theoretic model comparison approach indicated that an accelerated failure time Weibull model with all five covariates provided the best relative fit to the full data set. Prey type had a strong effect on prey identification time, with annelid worms having the shortest times (\u003c1 h) and caddisflies having the longest times (\u003e15 h). Water temperature decreased prey identification time (7.5% per 1°C increase), whereas prey count (i.e., meal size) increased prey identification time (15.5% per additional prey item). Predator body size had a weak negative effect on prey identification time (0.04% per 1‐mm increase). Body sizes of some prey taxa, including mayflies, caddisflies, and stoneflies, increased prey identification times, leading to an interaction between prey type and prey size. Our study highlights the utility of survival analysis for quantifying variation in prey identification times in the diets of generalist predators.

Although a seemingly harmless act, species introduction into a new ecosystem can have detrimental effects. Once introduced, invasive species may disrupt the existing ecosystem by competing with native species for limited resources.Freshwater ecosystems are heavily invaded, with native species at risk of being removed. Crayfish are one of the most widespread aquatic invaders around the world. They are introduced into freshwater ecosystems by fishermen who use them as bait and by schools who use them for scientific experiments. Crayfish affect stream food webs by competing with fishes and other invertebrates for food and shelter.\n\nThe invasive ringed crayfish (_Orconectes neglectus_), which are native to the Ozark region, appeared in the Willamette River basin for the first time in 2015. They have replaced the native signal crayfish (_Pacifastacus leniusculus_) in other river systems around Oregon. However, there have been no studies surrounding the interactions between ringed and signal crayfish.

I will collect both juveniles and adults of each crayfish species from streams in the Willamette River basin. The crayfish will be sustained in lab conditions one week before the experimental trials. Lab conditions will consist of a 14:10 hr light-dark cycle at 15°C. One ringed crayfish and one signal crayfish of similar size will be placed together in a tank for both food and shelter trials. Prior to the food competition experiment, the pair will be starved for 24 hours. After crayfish acclimate to the tank for 1 hour, I will place a worm in the tank and note which crayfish obtained the worm. If a trial lasts longer than 20 minutes, I will record it as a tie. The experimental trials for shelter will consist of the different crayfish pairs that were used for the food competition trials. A PVC half-tube shelter will be placed in the experimental tank. A pair consisting of a ringed crayfish and a signal crayfish will acclimate in the tank overnight. The following day, I will note how often each crayfish use the shelter every hour for 8 hours. Usage of the shelter will only be noted if 3/4 of the body are within the pipe. After the shelter experiment, I will also observe how often each species uses its shelter when put in a tank alone. Individual shelter usage will be noted every hour for 8 hours.

With these constraints, network size and connectance interact to produce a skewed distribution of interaction strengths whose skew becomes more pronounced with increasing complexity.

This “trophic downgrading” has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat declines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposed stricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three challenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophic interactions, such as resource limitation and competition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of a dynamic ecosystem requires an appreciation of the timing of recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences.

Therefore, understanding the processes that buffer biological communities from critical shifts and how our actions affect natural stabilizing feedbacks are important goals of ecology. One human activity with far reaching consequences for global ecosystems is the introduction of exotic species outside of their native ranges. Introduced predators, whose effects may be exacerbated by lack of shared evolutionary history with native prey, can have particularly strong effects on recipient communities. As trophic interactions play a central role in both population regulation and community persistence, it is essential to determine the extent to which introduction of novel predators can alter the function of stabilizing mechanisms.\n\nThe goals of this dissertation were to use a combination of manipulative field experiments and theoretical modeling to explore how introduced predators influence invaded communities through their effects on the processes that naturally maintain bounded prey population dynamics and promote community coexistence. Density- dependent predation can regulate prey populations by providing a negative feedback in response to changes in population size. In my first experiment (Chapter 2), I investigated the effects of invasive Indo-Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) on density-dependent mortality patterns previously documented to regulate a common native Atlantic prey species, the fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) on coral reefs in the Bahamas. By repeating a pre-invasion density-manipulation experiment, now in the context of predation by both native piscivores and lionfish, I demonstrated that per capita loss of fairy basslet remained density-dependent in the presence of lionfish, but the overall magnitude of loss was substantially greater compared to pre-invasion rates. Per capita loss was higher in 13 out of 16 basslet populations with an average increase of over 60% in the presence of the invader. The before-and-after design provided no evidence for a change in the intensity of density dependence between experiments, indicating the addition of destabilizing density-independent mortality caused by lionfish.\n\nIn my second experiment (Chapter 3), I employed a split-plot, cross-factored experimental design, manipulating both fairy basslet density and lionfish presence/absence such that differences in per capita loss rates were attributable only to predation by the invader. Over four weeks, mortality of fairy basslet was far greater on lionfish reefs compared to reefs with only native predators, displaying 2.4 times higher net loss on recruitment-enhanced fairy basslet populations and a five- fold increase in net loss at unmanipulated prey populations. Per capita loss was density-dependent in both predator treatments, but high mortality rates at low prey density on lionfish reefs resulted in extirpation of 15% of unmanipulated fairy basslet populations. In contrast, no prey populations were extirpated on reefs with only native predators.\n\nIn addition to field experiments, this dissertation includes a theoretical model (Chapter 4) that explored the effects of predator novelty on the coexistence of an intraguild predation web with adaptive antipredator defense in the shared prey. Adaptive prey responses can promote multi-predator coexistence by creating a stabilizing tradeoff in the allocation of predator-specific defense effort. Yet to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have accurate perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses, assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator. The model showed that the parameter region of IGP coexistence is dramatically reduced by an exotic predator but that effects of novelty on community persistence are complex and context-dependent. Specifically, the model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would persist in the absence of novelty. Coexistence is predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense compared to naïveté and differentially leads to exclusion of native predators in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low. Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. The results suggest that models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has significant implications for food web dynamics.\n\nOverall, the research described in this dissertation illuminates the mechanisms by which introduced predators can disrupt the boundedness and persistence of otherwise stable systems and provides insight into how predator novelty can alter biological communities via novel trophic and non-trophic interactions. As natural systems across the globe face multiple stressors that can alter their functioning, it is increasingly vital to understand the stabilizing mechanisms that buffer these systems from change, and how species introductions may modify the capacity for communities to respond to natural and human-caused disturbance.","tags":["Dynamics","Subtidal","Theory"],"title":"Effects of predator introductions on population and community dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kira Krumhansl","Dan Okamoto","Andy Rassweiler","Mark Novak","John Bolton","Kyle Cavanaugh","Sean Connell","Craig Johnson","Brenda Konar","Scott Ling","Fio Micheli","Kjell Norderhaug","Alejandro Pérez-Matus","Isabel Sousa-Pinto","Dan Reed","Anne Salomon","Nick Shears","Thomas Wernberg","Robert Anderson","Nevell Barrett","Alejandro Buschmann","Mark Carr","Jenn Caselle","Sandrine Derrien-Courtel","Graham Edgar","Matt Edwards","Jim Estes","Claire Goodwin","Mike Kenner","David Kushner","Frithjof Moy","Julia Nunn","Robert Steneck","Julio Vásquez","Jane Watson","Jon Witman","Jarrett Byrnes"],"categories":[],"content":" ","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371663,"objectID":"618dd0537702e8fb8e1d9d6f02883440","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/krumhansl-2016-sb/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:23.146872Z","relpermalink":"/publication/krumhansl-2016-sb/","section":"publication","summary":" Kelp forests (Order Laminariales) form key biogenic habitats in coastal regions of temperate and Arctic seas worldwide, providing ecosystem services valued in the range of billions of dollars annually. Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = −0.018 y−1). Our analysis identified declines in 38% of ecoregions for which there are data (−0.015 to −0.18 y−1), increases in 27% of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y−1), and no detectable change in 35% of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.

The field observation method estimates feeding rates based on feeding observations, handling times and prey abundances. Stable isotope analysis estimates diet proportions using mixing models of ratios of heavy to light carbon and nitrogen isotopes in body tissues of predators and their prey. However, because these two methods are relatively new, few studies have been conducted to understand and contrast their estimates of interaction strengths. I sought to quantify the correlation between the estimates of interaction strength made by the two methods. Both methods were conducted simultaneously in a rocky intertidal community on the Oregon coast with the whelk Nucella ostrina as the focal predator and the barnacle Balanus glandula and the mussel Mytilus trossulus as the two primary prey species. I documented a non-significant and weak correlation between the two method’s estimates of interaction strength. I hypothesize that this lack of correspondence between the methods may be explained by abnormal δ13C enrichment in the whelks compared to their prey, and a lack of variation in observed predator diets between replicate sample populations.

Analyses of feeding observations aggregated over hourly to annual intervals revealed a substantial bias associated with time aggregation that decreases the inferred magnitude of specialization and increases the inferred consistency of individuals’ diets. Time aggregation also made estimates of specialization more sensitive to the consideration of prey frequency, which decreased estimates relative to the use of prey incidence; time aggregation did not affect the extent to which under-sampling contributed to its overestimation. Our analyses demonstrate the importance of studying intraspecific diet variation with an explicit consideration of time and thereby suggest guidelines for future empirical efforts.

Many efforts to quantify temporal resolution have estimated rates of specimen decay from the frequency distribution of specimen ages in near-surface assemblages. The implicit assumption has been that the shape of these distributions is invariant with depth and thus decay-rate estimates reflect the temporal resolution of a fossil record’s deeper layers as well. Here we present a new model that predicts how age-frequency distribution shape will change with depth due to the interplay of burial, mixing, and decay. Unlike previous models, this model distinguishes the dimensions of time, specimen age, and depth, and predicts a right-to-left shift in age-frequency distribution skewness, and a decrease in kurtosis, with increasing stratigraphic depth. We find support for these predictions with the accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dating of 80 small mammal specimens spanning the Quaternary fossil record of Homestead Cave, Utah (United States). Our study indicates (1) that previous models overestimate rates of specimen decay, (2) that the acuity of ecological information captured in near-surface assemblages is higher than previously inferred, and (3) how time-averaging can alter the apparent dynamics of biodiversity over time. We thereby offer a new quantitative framework to account for time-averaging, to merge modern and paleontological archives, and to place ecological systems within the context of their past dynamics.

These events provide opportunities to evaluate the effects of bottom‐up forcing, top‐down control, and physical disturbance on shallow rocky reef communities.

I tested these predictions with a series of species-rich food webs along New Zealand's rocky shores, focusing on two predatory whelks, _Haustrum haustorium_, a trophic omnivore, and _Haustrum scobina_, the IG-prey. In contrast to theory, the IG-prey's abundance increased with productivity. Furthermore, feeding rates and allometric considerations indicate a competitive advantage for the omnivore when non-shared prey are considered, despite the IG-prey's superiority for shared prey. Nevertheless, clear and regular cross-gradient changes in network structure and interaction strengths were observed that challenge the assumptions of current theory. These insights suggest that the consideration of consumer-dependent functional responses, non-equilibrium dynamics, the dynamic nature of prey choice and non-trophic interactions among basal prey will be fruitful avenues for theoretical development.

An important component of species interactions that is rarely considered with respect to food webs is the strengths of interactions, which may affect both structure and dynamics. In natural systems, these strengths are variable, and can be quantified as probability distributions. We examined how variation in strengths of interactions can be described hierarchically, and how this variation impacts the structure of species interactions in predator–prey networks, both of which are important components of ecological food webs. The stable isotope ratios of predator and prey species may be particularly useful for quantifying this variability, and we show how these data can be used to build probabilistic predator–prey networks. Moreover, the distribution of variation in strengths among interactions can be estimated from a limited number of observations. This distribution informs network structure, especially the key role of dietary specialization, which may be useful for predicting structural properties in systems that are difficult to observe. Finally, using three mammalian predator–prey networks (two African and one Canadian) quantified from stable isotope data, we show that exclusion of link-strength variability results in biased estimates of nestedness and modularity within food webs, whereas the inclusion of body size constraints only marginally increases the predictive accuracy of the isotope-based network. We find that modularity is the consequence of strong link-strengths in both African systems, while nestedness is not significantly present in any of the three predator–prey networks.

Understanding and predicting the strength of biotic resistance remains a key challenge in invasion biology. A predator's functional response to nonnative prey may predict whether a predator can provide biotic resistance against nonnative prey at different prey densities. Surprisingly, functional responses have not been used to make quantitative predictions about biotic resistance. We parameterized the functional response of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) to invasive New Zealand mud snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum; NZMS) and used this functional response and a simple model of NZMS population growth to predict the probability of biotic resistance at different predator and prey densities. Signal crayfish were effective predators of NZMS, consuming more than 900 NZMS per predator in a 12‐h period, and Bayesian model fitting indicated their consumption rate followed a type 3 functional response to NZMS density. Based on this functional response and associated parameter uncertainty, we predict that NZMS will be able to invade new systems at low crayfish densities (\u003c0.2 crayfish/m2) regardless of NZMS density. At intermediate to high crayfish densities (\u003e0.2 crayfish/m2), we predict that low densities of NZMS will be able to establish in new communities; however, once NZMS reach a threshold density of ∼2000 NZMS/m2, predation by crayfish will drive negative NZMS population growth. Further, at very high densities, NZMS overwhelm predation by crayfish and invade. Thus, interacting thresholds of propagule pressure and predator densities define the probability of biotic resistance. Quantifying the shape and uncertainty of predator functional responses to nonnative prey may help predict the outcomes of invasions.

We use empirically based and simulated networks of varying size and connectance to assess two limitations to predicting perturbation responses in multispecies communities: (1) the inaccuracy by which species interaction strengths are empirically quantified and (2) the indeterminacy of species responses due to indirect effects associated with network size and structure. We find that even modest levels of species richness and connectance (∼25 pairwise interactions) impose high requirements for interaction strength estimates because system indeterminacy rapidly overwhelms predictive insights. Nevertheless, even poorly estimated interaction strengths provide greater average predictive certainty than an approach that uses only the sign of each interaction.

Empirical methods that measure the per capita strengths of trophic species interactions offer a means to identify keystone species and bridge mathematical models and data to synthesize our knowledge of population dynamics and predator feeding behaviors. Many such methods have been proposed, but few have seen independent validation of their estimates or underlying assumptions. This is particularly so with respect to the nonlinear functional responses by which predators often respond to their prey. Here I describe an empirical test of a recently proposed observational method for estimating the nonlinear strength of predator–prey interactions in the field. By applying the method to two populations of a predatory intertidal whelk, Haustrum scobina, I estimated its per capita attack rates on all nine of its observed prey species. These spanned two orders of magnitude in per capita strength. Concurrent experimental manipulations of the two predator populations provided population time series for the response of a mussel prey species, Xenostrobus pulex. I obtained independent interaction strength estimates for this focal interaction by fitting a sequence of hypothesized predator–prey models to these time series. Overall, site‐specific models assuming linear functional responses performed better than all others. A direct comparison of the attack‐rate estimates from the observational method with those of the best‐performing nonlinear model nevertheless revealed high concordance between the two methods. The results of this study therefore support the use of the observational method in larger and more complex food webs and suggest that trophic interactions in the range of mean prey densities observed in nature are approximately linear.

The now commonly performed removal or addition of predators, competitors, or mutualists to experimentally replicated populations of recipient species has irrefutably shown that species can have important effects on each other's populations, and that the strengths of these effects can vary considerably across environmental contexts and species identities. A large body of research is directed towards understanding this variation to forecast community dynamics and dissect how species interactions regulate community structure (Chesson 2000, McCann 2000, Stachowicz 2001, Duffy 2002). It has frequently been pointed out that progress in this field will require more explicit connections between ecological theory and the realities of nature (Laska and Wootton 1998, Parker et al. 1999, Berlow et al. 2004, Agrawal et al. 2007). This requires that interaction strengths measured experimentally be appropriate to the biology of our study systems and the mathematical abstractions we ascribe to them.\n\nHere we clarify some of the assumptions made in the application of the two most commonly used indices for measuring the strengths of species interactions with manipulative removal/addition experiments: Paine's index and the dynamic index. We explain how the values these indices are intended to measure – the per capita interaction strength between two species – are typically not estimated in common currencies. We then introduce extensions to these indices that alleviate a subset of previously made assumptions and limitations. These include a reformulation of Paine's index appropriate for an open‐recruitment system, and an extension of the dynamic index applicable to interactions of a particular nonlinear form. While we focus our language on predator–prey interactions, our discussions are pertinent to the measurement of species effects in other types of interactions as well (Mitchell and Wass 1996, Freckleton et al. 2009).

This is an observation‐based method, requiring three pieces of information: (1) species abundances, (2) predator and prey‐specific handling times, and (3) data from predator‐specific feeding surveys in which the number of individuals observed feeding on each of the predator's prey species has been tallied. The method offers a straightforward way to assess the completeness of one's sampling effort in accurately estimating interaction strengths through the construction of predator‐specific prey accumulation curves.

I introduce a new observational method for estimating the strengths of species interactions that accounts for the indeterminacy of omnivorous indirect effects and the saturating functional responses that predators exhibit. I present an empirical validation of the method’s accuracy by applying it to two populations of the predatory whelk, Haustrum (= Lepsiella) scobina, that is common to the rocky intertidal shores of New Zealand, and comparing these interaction strength estimates with those derived from concurrently performed experimental manipulations of H. scobina’s populations.\n\nI then test two key predictions of intraguild predation theory by investigating how species abundances, food web structure and species interactions strengths change across six omnivorous food webs along a gradient of productivity present around New Zealand’s coastline. I find that the intermediate predator, H. scobina, is the superior competitor for shared prey species, as predicted by theory.  Counter to theory, however, I show that it is the omnivorous whelk, H. haustorium, that is the superior competitor when all prey are considered, and that H. scobina’s abundance increases with increasing productivity. My analyses nevertheless reveal clear and regular cross-gradient shifts in interactions that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts.\n\nFinally, I ask to what degree whelk feeding rates are saturated with respect to prey densities and, by extending and parameterizing the classic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, ask whether empirical interactions are nonlinear enough to affect the stability of whelk-prey dynamics. Results indicate that whelk feeding rates are not strongly saturated and that increasing diet richness has a non-additive effect on a predator’s saturation such that alternative prey have a stabilizing effect on whelk-prey dynamics.  I thereby offer a new mechanism by which generalist predators stabilize the dynamics of their species-rich food webs that does not invoke prey switching.\n\nMy dissertation brings empirical data to bear on the importance of omnivory and the nonlinear nature of trophic interactions. Furthering our understanding of these food web features can contribute much to both the conceptual and applied goals of ecology.

Although the species are potential competitors that consume the same prey and utilize the same shelters, lobsters also prey on crabs (i.e., lobsters are intraguild predators of crabs). During daytime low tides, crabs are also preyed upon by Larus spp. gulls. In this study, I investigated the importance of avian and intraguild predation in influencing the diel and spatial (depth) patterns of decapod activity in the algal-covered lower intertidal and subtidal zones of Appledore Island, Maine, USA. During the summer months of 1999, the diel abundance and size distribution of active individuals was measured at several depths for each decapod species. Densities of active lobsters were highest at night and did not vary with depth. Contrary to prevailing knowledge, C. borealis and C. maenas were active almost exclusively during the day. While diurnal C. borealis were significantly more abundant in the deepest zone (9-11 m), C. maenas was not found at this depth and was most abundant in the shallowest zone (0-1 m). Day and night C. irroratus densities were not significantly different and showed no significant variation with depth. Only C. irroratus populations exhibited a diel difference in the mean size of individual crabs. The mean size of individuals observed during the day was larger than those observed at night. During the day, C. borealis were larger at depths of 9-11 m than at depths of 1-3 m, while C. maenas crabs were larger at depths of 5-7 m than at depths of 0-1 m.\nThe magnitude of avian predation was assessed by censuses of crab remains collected in the intertidal during periods of low tide. Results reinforce previous studies in suggesting that gulls are a major factor limiting the upper distribution of C. borealis. In the subtidal, the relative availability of potential shelters does not appear to account for the depth distributions observed among the species. The presence of a potentially sheltering Codium algal canopy at 1 to 7 m may be important for C. maenas and C. irroratus. A subtidal tethering experiment with C. borealis and C. irroratus revealed no diel or depth differences in crab survival. Overall, rates of predation were very low, but were significantly higher for small than for large crabs. Besides lobsters, no other predators were observed at the study site; predation on tethered crabs was therefore attributed to lobsters. In laboratory experiments exposing pairs of small and large C. borealis and C. irroratus to lobsters, small crabs were shown to be significantly more vulnerable to predation than large conspecifics; C. borealis and C. irroratus of similar size were equally vulnerable. Large crabs, however, were attacked 71 times more often than were small crabs. The results of this study reinforce concerns that traditional models of rocky shore community organization must be amended to include mobile predators. They indicate that competitive interactions between small crabs and lobsters may be unimportant relative to intraguild predation. For large crabs, perceived nocturnal intraguild predation pressures may be just as important as competitive interactions between guild members, especially in the recent absence of predatory fishes. These results underline the importance of understanding the ecological history of the community. They suggest that the overfishing of coastal fish populations has increased the relative importance of intraguild interactions and has thereby indirectly strengthened the link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

Maybe you’re far along in a series of analyses and feel “lost in the trees.”\nThis course will help you with these challenges by practicing the development and implementation of efficient, reproducible workflows for your projects. Every project should (and can) be modular and fully automated, hence reproducible, portable and easily modified. Rerunning an analysis with a different set of parameters should (and can) be as simple as a few keystrokes. Regenerating all figures and tables for your manuscript after finding a typo in your code or dataset should (and can) be painless.\nEfficient workflows start at project conception and end only if the project idea is itself a dead end. Thus, in this course, we’ll work to practice (1) refining and articulating project goals and benchmarks, (2) creating modular and automated analyses, and (3) using best practices in coding and project management. We’ll learn how to use Git, GitHub, LaTeX, Markdown, and high performance clusters (HPCs). The instructors will mostly use R within RStudio, but users of other programming languages and text editors are welcome and encouraged. You will need either (1) a dataset and a visualization or analysis goal, or (2) a model or simulation (or sufficiently well-developed ideas for one). The use of other people’s data or published models is also encouraged, as needed.\nAll teaching materials for this course are available on GitHub.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"95cf706f78daf24e44361c7e60cbda4f","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/courses/analyticalworkflows/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/analyticalworkflows/","section":"courses","summary":"Tools and best-practices for efficient project managment","tags":["Graduate"],"title":"Analytical Workflows (IB516)","type":"courses"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course description A workshop-style short-course at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory aiming to introduce basic concepts and tools for the statistical integration of the mathematical models and empirical data for characterizing species interactions.\nSee https://models4data2theory.github.io for details.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bce093d309189278043d07240bd9fc00","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/courses/rmbl/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/rmbl/","section":"courses","summary":"Workshop at RMBL on integrating theory and data on species interactions","tags":["Graduate"],"title":"Data-Theory Integration","type":"courses"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course description This ecology course consists of an introduction to the scientific study of the processes that shape the distribution, structure and dynamics of species and their communities.
