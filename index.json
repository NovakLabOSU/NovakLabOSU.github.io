you\u0026rsquo;d like to work on, what motivates you to work on them, and what you\u0026rsquo;d like to come away with at the end in terms of your \u0026ldquo;tool kit\u0026rdquo;.) Please also attach a CV/resume and contact information for three references. The application deadline for our department is mid-December. Our department guarantee\u0026rsquo;s 5 years of support to all its PhD students in the form of TAships. Nevertheless, I strongly encourage you to have applied for the various pre-doctoral fellowships, most of which have earlier deadlines. More information on the department\u0026rsquo;s grad program and application process can be found on our department\u0026rsquo;s website.\nUndergraduate students Undergraduates become involved in our research through a variety of ways, ranging from volunteer opportunities, paid assistantships, as well as independent research experiences. We are actively fostering diversity within the lab, so I encourage all interested students to contact me (or the lab’s graduate students and postdocs). Volunteer and paid assistantship opportunities often involve working with myself or a graduate student supporting the research projects of the lab. Volunteers have often ended up becoming paid research assistants or have pursued their own “independent” research projects (particularly when they’ve joined the lab early in their undergraduate careers). Independent research experiences typically involve student-led projects for transcript credit (incl. transcript-visible “distinction in research”), fulfilling Honors requirements, or academic- and/or summer quarter research supported by scholarships or fellowships (e.g., URISC, SURE, etc.).

Despite their broad relevance and long-standing history, we show here that the types of density dependence found in classic resource- and consumer-dependent functional-response models equate to strong and often untenable assumptions about the independence of processes underlying feeding rates. We first demonstrate mathematically how to quantify non-independence between feeding and consumer interference and between feeding on multiple resources. We then analyse two large collections of functional-response data sets to show that non-independence is pervasive and borne out in previously hidden forms of density dependence. Our results provide a new lens through which to view variation in consumer feeding rates and disentangle the biological underpinnings of species interactions in multi-species contexts.","tags":[],"title":"Hidden layers of density dependence in consumer feeding rates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Novak","Stouffer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371666,"objectID":"0da1faa2594bf15f67f6a380cfe209a8","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/novak-2021-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:26.225358Z","relpermalink":"/publication/novak-2021-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Functional responses are a cornerstone to our understanding of consumer-resource interactions, so how to best describe them using models has been actively debated. Here we focus on the consumer dependence of functional responses to evidence systematic bias in the statistical comparison of functional-response models and the estimation of their parameters. Both forms of bias are universal to nonlinear models (irrespective of consumer dependence) and are rooted in a lack of sufficient replication. Using a large compilation of published datasets, we show that ? due to the prevalence of low sample size studies ? neither the overall frequency by which alternative models achieve top rank nor the frequency distribution of parameter point estimates should be treated as providing insight into the general form or central tendency of consumer interference. We call for renewed clarity in the varied purposes that motivate the study of functional responses, purposes that can compete with each other in dictating the design, analysis and interpretation of functional-response experiments.","tags":[],"title":"Systematic bias in studies of consumer functional responses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Preston","Layden","Segui","Falke","Brant","Novak"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371667,"objectID":"f5425e5bdd434311cc2198e005d07adb","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/preston-2021-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:27.242693Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preston-2021-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Although parasites are increasingly recognized for their ecosystem roles, it is often assumed that free-living organisms dominate animal biomass in most ecosystems and therefore provide the primary pathways for energy transfer. To examine the contributions of parasites to ecosystem energetics in freshwater streams, we quantified the standing biomass of trematodes and free-living organisms at nine sites in three streams in western Oregon, USA. We then compared the rates of biomass flow from snails Juga plicifera into trematode parasites relative to aquatic vertebrate predators (sculpin, cutthroat trout and Pacific giant salamanders). The trematode parasite community had the fifth highest dry biomass density among stream organisms (0.40 g/m2) and exceeded the combined biomass of aquatic insects. Only host snails (3.88 g/m2), sculpin (1.11 g/m2), trout (0.73 g/m2) and crayfish (0.43 g/m2) had a greater biomass. The parasite ?extended phenotype?, consisting of trematode plus castrated host biomass, exceeded the individual biomass of every taxonomic group other than snails. The substantial parasite biomass stemmed from the high snail density and infection prevalence, and the large proportional mass of infected hosts that consisted of trematode tissue (M = 31% per snail). Estimates of yearly biomass transfer from snails into trematodes were slightly higher than the combined estimate of snail biomass transfer into the three vertebrate predators. Pacific giant salamanders accounted for 90% of the snail biomass consumed by predators. These results demonstrate that trematode parasites play underappreciated roles in the ecosystem energetics of some freshwater streams.","tags":[],"title":"Trematode parasites exceed aquatic insect biomass in Oregon stream food webs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Falke","Henderson","Novak","Preston"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371662,"objectID":"d7e81b76ebaae0a70d852a6c676da369","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/falke-2020-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:21.952572Z","relpermalink":"/publication/falke-2020-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Intraspecific variation is increasingly recognized as an important factor in ecological interactions that can exceed the role of interspecific variation. Few studies, however, have examined how variation in intra- and interspecific resource use affect trophic interactions over time within a seasonally-dynamic food web. We compared diets with respect to predator body size and predator species identity over 3 seasons by collecting stomach contents from 2028 Reticulate Sculpin (Cottus perplexus), 479 Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), and 107 Pacific Giant Salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in western Oregon streams. In each season, predator body size was strongly associated with dietary composition and positively related to taxonomic breadth and the size of individual prey. Intra- and interspecific diet variation changed substantially across seasons, with much greater interspecific variation in spring than in summer and autumn. Interspecific differences in foraging mode (e.g., benthic vs drift feeding) were associated with predator-specific responses to a seasonal pulse in the availability of terrestrial thrip larvae (Thysanoptera) and contributed to temporal variation in trophic niche differentiation. These findings show that the relative magnitudes of intra- and interspecific diet differentiation can change over time in systems that receive seasonal resource pulses. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of food webs and the need to incorporate sampling over relevant temporal scales to understand species interactions.","tags":[],"title":"Temporal shifts in intraspecific and interspecific diet variation among 3 stream predators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shannon Hennessey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617376892,"objectID":"462034a5580757d386e9abf06e1320d7","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/hennessey-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T15:21:32.607426Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hennessey-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The influence of prey predictability on the foraging behavior and movement of intertidal predators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Menge","Caselle","Barth","Blanchette","Carr","Chan","Gravem","Gouhier","Lubchenco","McManus","Milligan","Novak","Raimondi","Washburn","White"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371663,"objectID":"c2d84c328299e3e5cf282b5d2af6ab29","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/menge-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:23.326542Z","relpermalink":"/publication/menge-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Community Responses to Climate-Related Variability and Disease: The Critical Importance of Long-Term Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Preston","Falke","Henderson","Novak"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371667,"objectID":"6a74ecb804b056d444f8f0dd37aa353f","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/preston-2019-ab/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:27.073999Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preston-2019-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"Species interactions in food webs are usually recognized as dynamic, varying across species, space, and time because of biotic and abiotic drivers. Yet food webs also show emergent properties that appear consistent, such as a skewed frequency distribution of interaction strengths (many weak, few strong). Reconciling these two properties requires an understanding of the variation in pairwise interaction strengths and its underlying mechanisms. We estimated stream sculpin feeding rates in three seasons at nine sites in Oregon to examine variation in trophic interaction strengths both across and within predator?prey pairs. Predator and prey densities, prey body mass, and abiotic factors were considered as putative drivers of within-pair variation over space and time. We hypothesized that consistently skewed interaction strength distributions could result if individual interaction strengths show relatively little variation, or alternatively, if interaction strengths vary but shift in ways that conserve their overall frequency distribution. Feeding rate distributions remained consistently and positively skewed across all sites and seasons. The mean coefficient of variation in feeding rates within each of 25 focal species pairs across surveys was less than half the mean coefficient of variation seen across species pairs within a survey. The rank order of feeding rates also remained conserved across streams, seasons and individual surveys. On average, feeding rates on each prey taxon nonetheless varied by a hundredfold, with some feeding rates showing more variation in space and others in time. In general, feeding rates increased with prey density and decreased with high stream flows and low water temperatures, although for nearly half of all species pairs, factors other than prey density explained the most variation. Our findings show that although individual interaction strengths exhibit considerable variation in space and time, they can nonetheless remain relatively consistent, and thus predictable, compared to the even larger variation that occurs across species pairs. These results highlight how the ecological scale of inference can strongly shape conclusions about interaction strength consistency and help reconcile how the skewed nature of interaction strength distributions can persist in highly dynamic food webs.","tags":[],"title":"Food-web interaction strength distributions are conserved by greater variation between than within predator--prey pairs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Menge","Caselle","Milligan","Gravem","Gouhier","White","Barth","Blanchette","Carr","Chan","Lubchenco","McManus","Novak","Raimondi","Washburn"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371663,"objectID":"51cbc4e6e104004542f9ea991096ed68","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/menge-2019-ab/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:23.555307Z","relpermalink":"/publication/menge-2019-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Integrating Coastal Oceanic and Benthic Ecological Approaches for Understanding Large-Scale Meta-Ecosystem Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Menge","Milligan","Caselle","Barth","Blanchette","Carr","Chan","Cowen","Denny","Gaines","Hofmann","Kroeker","Lubchenco","McManus","Novak","Palumbi","Raimondi","Somero","Warner","Washburn","White"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371663,"objectID":"51df9781a6ebacb7e93b486f3f0d51d9","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/menge-2019-ac/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:23.763891Z","relpermalink":"/publication/menge-2019-ac/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PISCO: Advances Made Through the Formation of a Large-Scale, Long-Term Consortium for Integrated Understanding of Coastal Ecosystem Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kroeker","Carr","Raimondi","Caselle","Washburn","Palumbi","Barth","Chan","Menge","Milligan","Novak","White"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371663,"objectID":"4e96428d024037fb2aa8b7ef9a639d4f","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/kroeker-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:22.981178Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kroeker-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Planning for Change: Assessing the Potential Role of Marine Protected Areas and Fisheries Management Approaches for Resilience Management in a Changing Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leah Segui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617376893,"objectID":"b000eea7ac7e3d55de88efb4b53983ad","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/segui-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T15:21:32.998191Z","relpermalink":"/publication/segui-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"State-structured species interactions and their consequences across levels of biological organization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pennekamp","Iles","Garland","Brennan","Brose","Gaedke","Jacob","Kratina","Matthews","Munch","Novak","Palamara","Rall","Rosenbaum","Tabi","Ward","Williams","Ye","Petchey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371666,"objectID":"3b75c66b7626aebea848d0cc3d72b653","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/pennekamp-2019-uq/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:26.39242Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pennekamp-2019-uq/","section":"publication","summary":"Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are complex, stochastic, and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems? intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE?FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.","tags":["\"empirical dynamic modelling; forecasting; information theory; permutation entropy; population dynamics; time series analysis\""],"title":"The intrinsic predictability of ecological time series and its potential to guide forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kyle Coblentz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617376892,"objectID":"a78290927653e91fd9c7fb593820103c","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/coblentz-2018-aa/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T15:21:28.098015Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coblentz-2018-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Candidate causes, consequences, and estimation of individual diet specialization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koslicki","Novak"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371662,"objectID":"50efc86de60f6374876f752490926c57","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/koslicki-2018-zm/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:22.792016Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koslicki-2018-zm/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the goal of predicting how complex networks respond to chronic (press) perturbations when characterizations of their network topology and interaction strengths are associated with uncertainty.

Multiple factors have been linked to trophic interaction strength variation, including species densities, species traits, and abiotic factors. Yet most empirical tests of the relative roles of multiple mechanisms that drive variation have been limited to simplified experiments that may diverge from the dynamics of natural food webs. Here, we used a field-based observational approach to quantify the roles of prey density, predator density, predator-prey body-mass ratios, prey identity, and abiotic factors in driving variation in feeding rates of reticulate sculpin (Cottus perplexus). We combined data on over 6,000 predator-prey observations with prey identification time functions to estimate 289 prey-specific feeding rates at nine stream sites in Oregon. Feeding rates on 57 prey types showed an approximately log-normal distribution, with few strong and many weak interactions. Model selection indicated that prey density, followed by prey identity, were the two most important predictors of prey-specific sculpin feeding rates. Feeding rates showed a positive relationship with prey taxon densities that was inconsistent with predator saturation predicted by current functional response models. Feeding rates also exhibited four orders-of-magnitude in variation across prey taxonomic orders, with the lowest feeding rates observed on prey with significant anti-predator defenses. Body-mass ratios were the third most important predictor variable, showing a hump-shaped relationship with the highest feeding rates at intermediate ratios. Sculpin density was negatively correlated with feeding rates, consistent with the presence of intraspecific predator interference. Our results highlight how multiple co-occurring drivers shape trophic interactions in nature and underscore ways in which simplified experiments or reliance on scaling laws alone may lead to biased inferences about the structure and dynamics of species-rich food webs.","tags":[],"title":"What drives interaction strengths in complex food webs?

This effort has focused primarily on statistical significance testing and obtaining point estimates of parameters that contribute to interaction strength magnitudes, leaving the characterization of uncertainty associated with those estimates unconsidered. We consider a means of characterizing the uncertainty of a generalist predator's interaction strengths by formulating an observational method for estimating a predator's prey-specific per capita attack rates as a Bayesian statistical model. This formulation permits the explicit incorporation of multiple sources of uncertainty. A key insight is the informative nature of several so-called non-informative priors that have been used in modeling the sparse data typical of predator feeding surveys. We introduce to ecology a new neutral prior and provide evidence for its superior performance. We use a case study to consider the attack rates in a New Zealand intertidal whelk predator, and we illustrate not only that Bayesian point estimates can be made to correspond with those obtained by frequentist approaches, but also that estimation uncertainty as described by 95% intervals is more useful and biologically realistic using the Bayesian method. In particular, unlike in bootstrap confidence intervals, the lower bounds of the Bayesian posterior intervals for attack rates do not include zero when a predator--prey interaction is in fact observed. We conclude that the Bayesian framework provides a straightforward, probabilistic characterization of interaction strength uncertainty, enabling future considerations of both the deterministic and stochastic drivers of interaction strength and their impact on food webs.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian characterization of uncertainty in species interaction strengths","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Witman","Smith","Novak"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617371668,"objectID":"26c3be46efafaa64df7cca3cee1b8214","permalink":"https://novaklabosu.github.io/publication/witman-2017-jm/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T13:54:28.582235Z","relpermalink":"/publication/witman-2017-jm/","section":"publication","summary":"In diverse tropical webs, trophic cascades are presumed to be rare, as species interactions may dampen top-down control and reduce their prevalence. To test this hypothesis, we used an open experimental design in the Galápagos rocky subtidal that enabled a diverse guild of fish species, in the presence of each other and top predators (sea lions and sharks), to attack two species of sea urchins grazing on benthic algae. Time-lapse photography of experiments on natural and experimental substrates revealed strong species identity effects: only two predator species--blunthead triggerfish (Pseudobalistes naufragium) and finescale triggerfish (Balistes polylepis)--drove a diurnal trophic cascade extending to algae, and they preferred large pencil urchins (Eucidaris galapagensis) over green urchins (Lytechinus semituberculatus). Triggerfish predation effects were strong, causing a 24-fold reduction of pencil urchin densities during the initial 21 hours of a trophic cascade experiment. A trophic cascade was demonstrated for pencil urchins, but not for green urchins, by significantly higher percent cover of urchin-grazed algae in cages that excluded predatory fish than in predator access (fence) treatments. Pencil urchins were more abundant at night when triggerfish were absent, suggesting that this species persists by exploiting a nocturnal predation refuge. Time-series of pencil urchin survivorship further demonstrated per capita interference effects of hogfish and top predators. These interference effects respectively weakened and extended the trophic cascade to a fourth trophic level through behavioral modifications of the triggerfish-urchin interaction. We conclude that interference behaviors capable of modifying interaction strength warrant greater attention as mechanisms for altering top-down control, particularly in speciose food webs.","tags":[],"title":"Experimental demonstration of a trophic cascade in the Galápagos rocky subtidal:  Effects of consumer identity and

key assumption of the ideal free distribution (IFD) is that there are no costs in moving between habitat patches. However, because many populations exhibit more or less continuous population movement between patches and traveling cost is a frequent factor, it is important to determine the effects of costs on expected population movement patterns and spatial distributions. We consider a food chain (tritrophic or bitrophic) in which one species moves between patches, with energy cost or mortality risk in movement. In the two-patch case, assuming forced movement in one direction, an evolutionarily stable strategy requires bidirectional movement, even if costs during movement are high. In the N-patch case, assuming that at least one patch is linked bidirectionally to all other patches, optimal movement rates can lead to source-sink dynamics where patches with negative growth rates are maintained by other patches with positive growth rates. As well, dispersal between patches is not balanced (even in the two-patch case), leading to a deviation from the IFD. Our results indicate that cost-associated forced movement can have important consequences for spatial metapopulation dynamics. Relevance to marine reserve design and the study of stream communities subject to drift is discussed.","tags":[],"title":"The Effect of Travel Loss on Evolutionarily Stable Distributions of

you proposed a modeling chapter for your dissertation but need support getting things up and running?

Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re far along in a series of analyses and feel \u0026ldquo;lost in the trees.\u0026rdquo;\nThis course will help you with these challenges by practicing the development and implementation of efficient, reproducible workflows for your projects. Every project should (and can) be modular and fully automated, hence reproducible, portable and easily modified. Rerunning an analysis with a different set of parameters should (and can) be as simple as a few keystrokes. Regenerating all figures and tables for your manuscript after finding a typo in your code or dataset should (and can) be painless.\nEfficient workflows start at project conception and end only if the project idea is itself a dead end. Thus, in this course, we\u0026rsquo;ll work to practice (1) refining and articulating project goals and benchmarks, (2) creating modular and automated analyses, and (3) using best practices in coding and project management. We\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to use Git, GitHub, LaTeX, Markdown, and high performance clusters (HPCs). The instructors will mostly use R within RStudio, but users of other programming languages and text editors are welcome and encouraged. You will need either (1) a dataset and a visualization or analysis goal, or (2) a model or simulation (or sufficiently well-developed ideas for one). The use of other people\u0026rsquo;s data or published models is also encouraged, as needed.\nAll teaching materials for this course are available on GitHub.
